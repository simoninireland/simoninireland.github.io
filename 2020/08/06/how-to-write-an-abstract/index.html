      <p>I've spent much of this week working with MSc students writing their
dissertations, and this has inevitably led to the part of a
dissertation that often causes the most pain to write (and read, for
that matter): the abstract.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>What is the abstract of a report or paper? What it isn't is an
introduction or guide to the rest of the document: that,
unsurprisingly, is what the introduction is for. The goal of an
abstract is much simpler: it's intended to persuade the reader to read
some or all of the rest of the document. It may be surprising that
this is an issue, but in a world in the grip of an information
explosion it's clear that readers' attention is a limiting quantity in
information processing. As a reader, should you bother to read a
paper? Or not? And how do you make this decision?</p>
<p>Many new researchers, when confronted with a paper, start at the front
and work forward. More experienced researchers know this is a mistake
that leads to reading whole tracts of irrelevance or nonsense. (The
former is worse: nonsense at least has occasional entertainment
value.) This leads many people (myself included) to adopt a non-linear
reading style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the abstract</li>
<li>If still interested, read the conclusion</li>
<li>If <em>still</em> interested, read the introduction</li>
<li>If it's <em>really</em> interesting, read the rest of the paper</li>
</ul>
<p>(There are several variants, a couple of which are described here and
here.) The point here is that we can filter out papers of lesser
interest to reserve time and head space for the most interesting. Only
if the results grab your attention do you need to spend time
discovering the detail of how they were obtained -- rather than doing
that work only discover that you don't care about the results being
reported.</p>
<p>The abstract is the key: without a decent description of what the
paper is about, the discerning reader will not proceed even to the
introduction, and therefore any work contained in the paper will
remain unread -- and therefore be largely worthless.</p>
<p>So how does one write a decent abstract? Most experienced scientists
have their own technique, and the approach does need to vary from
field to field and for different paper styles: a review paper is
different to a piece of primary research. The approach I've come to
rely on for research in computer science and mathematics can be
described succinctly as the five-sentence abstract. I've found five
sentences seems to be about optimal, structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="color: red">The area of the paper (1 sentence).</span>
  The problem area to which this paper makes a contribution.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: orange">The issue the paper addresses (1
  sentence).</span> Presumably the area is not yet fully explored, and
  you've found a problem that needs tackling otherwise what's in your
  paper?</li>
<li>
<span style="color: green">What you've done, the results you've
  obtained (2 sentences).</span> The key contribution of the paper,
  what you've added to practice and/or knowledge</li>
<li>
<span style="color: blue">What this means (1 sentence).</span> Why
  should anyone care?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's do an example, from a paper I've always wanted to write about
finding unicorns:</p>
<p><span style="color: red">There are lots of interesting animals out
there, many of which have horns.</span> <span style="color:
orange">No-one has yet reported observing any one-horned horses,
however.</span> <span style="color: green">We describe our research
survey of the horses of Orkney. While we found many horses, and many
other horned animals, we failed to locate any horned horses.</span>
<span style="color: blue">We conclude that further research is
required to find unicorns, preferably in an equally pleasant holiday
destination.</span></p>
<p>OK, perhaps not a great example. Let's try another, from a real paper:</p>
<p><span style="color: red">In the domain of ubiquitous computing, the ability to identify the
occurrence of situations is a core function of being
context-aware.</span> <span style="color: orange">Given the uncertain nature of sensor information and
inference rules, reasoning techniques that cater for uncertainty hold
promise for enhancing the reasoning process.</span> <span style="color: green">In our work, we apply the
Dempster Shafer theory of evidence to infer situation occurrence with
the minimal use of training data. We describe a set of evidential
operations for sensor mass functions using context quality and
evidence accumulation for continuous situation detection.</span> <span style="color: blue">We
demonstrate how our approach enables situation inference with
uncertain information using a case study based on a published smart
home data set.</span></p>
<p>(From ) The abstract goes
from domain to challenge to approach to significance: having read it,
the reader hopefully has a fairly good idea of what the paper
contributes to which domain, and why this contribution is significant
(in the authors' minds, at least).</p>
<p>Shorter is often better, of course:</p>
<p><span style="color: red">Wireless sensor networks are attracting increasing interest but suffer
from severe challenges such as power constraints and low data
reliability.</span> <span style="color: orange">Sensors are often energy-hungry and cannot operate over
the long term, and the data they gather are frequently erroneous in
complex ways. The two problems are linked, but existing work typically
treats them independently:</span> <span style="color: green">in this paper we consider both
side-by-side, and propose a self-organising solution for model-based
data collection</span> <span style="color: blue">that reduces errors and communications in a unified
fashion.</span></p>
<p>(From ) In this case my then-student
Lei messed with the sentence structure because we wanted to get across
the idea that the main problem was the totality of the existing
approach to the problem, which we wanted to address as a whole. The
abstract still follows the basic structure, and I think is stronger
for being shorter.</p>
<p>No rule of writing is hard-and-fast, of course, and so you'll often
find great abstracts that adopt a completely different approach. I
don't think this matters so much as ensuring that the abstract is fit
for purpose: an enticement to read further.</p>

<!--more-->

The 2011 / 2012 <span class="caps">CPHC</span>/<span class="caps">BCS</span> Distinguished Dissertations competition is now open for submissions via the web site

<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=disdis12">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=disdis12</a>

Closing date Monday 2nd April 2012. Further details can be found below and on the webpage

<a href="http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=nav.5820">http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=nav.5820</a>

The Conference of Professors and Heads of Computing (<span class="caps">CPHC</span>), in conjunction with <span class="caps">BCS</span>, The Chartered Institute for <span class="caps">IT</span>, annually selects for publication the best British PhD/DPhil dissertations in computer science.

The scheme aims to make more visible the significant contribution made by Britain &#8212; in particular by post-graduate students &#8212; to computer science. Publication also serves to provide a model for future students.

The selection panel on behalf of <span class="caps">BCS</span>/<span class="caps">CPHC</span> consists of experienced computer scientists, not more than one from any institution, each normally serving on the panel for three years. The 2012 panel members are: Simon Thompson (Kent, Chair), Teresa Attwood (Manchester), Russell Beale (Birmingham), Simon Dobson (St Andrews), Zoubin Ghahramani (Cambridge), Joemon Jose (Glasgow), Daniel Kroening (Oxford), Ralph Martin (Cardiff), Alexander Romanovsky (Newcastle) and Jon Whittle (Lancaster).

Any dissertation is eligible which is submitted for a doctorate in the British Isles in what is commonly understood as Computer Science. (Theses which are basically in some other discipline but which make use, even very extensive use, of computing will not be regarded as eligible.)  However, there is a limit of <span class="caps">THREE</span> dissertations per year per university, and one per research group within any university.

To be considered, a dissertation&nbsp;should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>make a noteworthy contribution to the&nbsp;subject;</li>
    <li>reach a high standard of&nbsp;exposition;</li>
    <li>place its results clearly in the context of computer science as a whole;&nbsp;and</li>
    <li>enable a computer scientist with significantly different interests to grasp its&nbsp;essentials.</li>
</ul>
It is reasonable to submit a thesis to the scheme if it has all of the above qualities in good measure, and if it is comparable in standard with the top 10% of dissertations in the subject. Long dissertations are not encouraged; if the main text is more than 80,000 words, there should be good justification.

The dissertation should be submitted electronically (as a <span class="caps">PDF</span> file) by the author&#8217;s examiners, or by the Head of Department with the examiner&#8217;s advice. The submitted version of the dissertation must be the final version after any required corrections have been made. The competition period for 2012 is for theses accepted from 1st January 2011 until the closing date of 2nd April 2012. A dissertation cannot be submitted to the competition more than once.

The dissertation should be accompanied by a written nomination comprising the following information:
<ul>
<li>a justification, of about 300 words, by one of the examiners &#8212; preferably the external &#8212; explaining the dissertation&#8217;s claim to distinction (against the criteria listed&nbsp;above);</li>
    <li>the name of the primary supervisor and the research group within the university to which the student was primarily&nbsp;affiliated;</li>
    <li>an assurance that within the competition period the examiners have recommended to the author&#8217;s institution that the doctorate should be awarded;&nbsp;and</li>
    <li>the names and contact details of three suggested reviewers who are not in the same Department as the nominated thesis and who are independent of the supervision and examining of the thesis. The nominated reviewers must have confirmed that they are willing to provide a&nbsp;review.</li>
</ul>
An indication should be given if the dissertation is being considered for publication elsewhere.  In addition the author&#8217;s written agreement that their thesis may be considered for the Distinguished Dissertation competition should be emailed by the author to  <a href="mailto:disdis12@easychair.org">disdis12@easychair.org</a>.

Submissions should be made on-line via     <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=disdis12">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=disdis12</a>.  The first author name submitted should be that of the thesis author; the individual submitting the nomination should list themselves as the second author. The title and abstract should be those of the thesis being nominated. The first file uploaded should be the 300 word nomination; the thesis document should be uploaded as an attachment.  If any problems are experienced, or you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:disdis12@easychair.org">disdis12@easychair.org</a> for assistance.

The deadline for submission is 2nd April 2012.

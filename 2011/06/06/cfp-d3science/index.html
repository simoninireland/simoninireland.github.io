<a href="http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/D3Science/" target="_blank">Workshop on D3Science</a> - Call for Papers</h2>
<div>
<h3>(To be held with <a href="http://www.escience2011.org/" target="_blank">IEEE e-Science 2011</a>)
Monday, 5 December 2011

This workshop is interested in data-intensive, distributed, and dynamic (D3) science. It will also focus on innovative approaches for scalability in the end-to-end real-time processing of scientific data. We refer to D3 applications as those are data-intensive, are fundamentally, or need to be, distributed, and need to support and respond to data that may be non-persistent and is dynamically generated. We are also looking to bring researchers together to look at holistic, rather than piecewise, approaches to the end-to-end processing and managing of scientific data.

There has been a lot of effort in managing and distributing tasks where computation is dominant. Such applications have after all, been historically the drivers of "grid" computing. There has been, however, relatively less effort on tasks where the computationalload is matched by the data load, or even dominated by the data load. For such tasks to be able to operate at scale, there are conceptually simple run-time tradeoffs that need to be made, such as determining whether to move data to compute versus moving compute to data, or possibly regenerating data on-the-fly. Due to fluctuating resource availability and capabilities, as well as insufficient prior information about application requirements, such decisions must be made at run-time. Furthermore, resource, connectivity and/or storage constraints may require the data to be manipulated in-transit so that it is "made-right" for the consumer. Currently it is very difficult to implement these dynamic decisions or the underlying mechanisms in a general-purpose and scalable fashion. Although the increasing volumes and complexity of data will make many problems data-dominated, the computational requirements will still be high. In practice, data-intensive applications will encompass data-driven applications. For example, many data-driven applications will involve computational activities triggered as a consequence of independently created data; thus it is imperative for an application to be able to respond to unplanned changes in data load or content. Therefore, understanding how to support dynamic computations is a fundamental, but currently missing element in data-intensive computing.

The D3Science workshop builds upon a 3 year research theme on Distributed Programming Abstractions (DPA, <a href="http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/Distributed_Programming_Abstractions">http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/Distributed_Programming_Abstractions</a>), which has held a series of related workshops including but not limited to e-Science 2008, EuroPar 2008 and the CLADE series, and the ongoing 3DPAS (<a href="http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/3DPAS">http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/3DPAS</a>) research theme funded by the NSF and UK EPSRC, which is holding one workshop in June 2011: the 3DAPAS workshop (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/3dapas/">https://sites.google.com/site/3dapas/</a>). The workshop is intended to lead to a funding proposal for transcontinental collaboration, with contributors as potential members of the collaboration, and as such, we are particularly interested is discussing both existing and future projects that are suitable for transcontinental collaboration.

<p><code>epyc</code> is a library to manage large sets of computational experiments.</p>
<p>Computational science often needs us to perform a lot of repetitions
of experiments, for example to reduce variance or to cancel out
strange artefacts. Typically one might also want to perform a set of
experiments across a parameter space, varying one or more parameters
to see their effect. All these tasks generate a lot of repetitions
that need to be managed while they’re on-going, and a lot of result
data that needs to be kept archived.</p>
<p>These activities are so structured, so repetitive, and so common, that
they cry out for automation — but there didn’t seem to be an
automation library for doing this sort of thing in Python. So I wrote
one.</p>
<p><code>epyc</code> is being used to manage experiments within my complex networks
blog/book, but it can manage any kind of experiment written in Python,
and can run experiments in parallel using an

<p><code>epydemic</code> is a library for simulating epidemic processes over
networks.</p>
<p>Network science uses epidemic spreading processes a lot, both for the
obvious application of modelling diseases, but also for things that
are mathematically similar such as computer viruses and
rumour-spreading. Some simulations use discrete-time approaches where
lots of events happen in a single timestep; others — and this is more
common for research-grade software — use continuous-time stochastic or
Gillespie simulation, which can be significantly faster and is
statistically exact, but is also a lot harder to code up. There didn’t
seem to be a reusable simulation library that would play well with
<a href="https://networkx.github.io/"><code>networkx</code></a>, so I wrote one in the
course of writing my complex networks blog/book. <code>epydemic</code> releases
this code from the book and allows it to be used stand-alone. For good
measure I integrated it with <a href="/pages/epyc/"><code>epyc</code></a> to allow for reproducible
simulations at scale.</p>

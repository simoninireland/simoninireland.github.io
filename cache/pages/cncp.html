<p><em>Complex networks, complex processes</em> is best described as "notes for
a book" which will hopefully emerge over time.</p>
<p>I became interested in complex networks and their applications largely
through working with my student Saray Shai. In getting to grips with
complex networks, one has to grapple with the leading edges of both
maths and computer science â€” something that few people (and definitely
not me) have the background for. Largely to guide my own study, I
started writing notes about the topics I encountered in a form that
would serve as a practical introduction to someone wanting to start
working in the area, and these notes are now morphing into an open
textbook. As the name suggests, the aim of the book is to cover the
construction, analysis, and simulation of networks and the processes
that run over them, when applied to real-world problems.</p>

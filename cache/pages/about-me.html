<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m a computer scientist, a wannabe mathematician/astronaut, and a photographer.
My main research interests these days are in complex systems, data science, sensing,
and data interpretation.</p>
<p>I work at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk">University of St Andrews</a> and live in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilconquhar">Kilconquhar</a> in Fife.
Originally I’m from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runcorn">Runcorn</a>, just
outside Liverpool in the north-west of England. I came to St Andrews by way of
Newcastle upon Tyne, York, Oxford, Dublin, and Co Sligo: good luck tracing my accent.</p>

<p>My lockdown project is now ready for its first outing.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p><a href="https://simoninireland.github.io/introduction-to-epidemics">Epidemic modelling -- some notes, maths, and code</a>
is intended as a non-technical introduction to epidemic modelling
on networks. It's unusual in being written as a set of executable
<a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter notebooks</a> so that all the code needed
to run the experiments presented, and to create the graphs and other
elements, are all included up-front.</p>
<p>It's been an interesting way to spend some of my time lockdown.
Firstly, it's been exciting to try to explain these ideas accessibly.
The need for public understanding of science has never been greater,
and it comes as something of a shock to realise <em>how much learning</em> there
is to be able to understand some of the arguments -- and in some cases how
much suspension of disbelief this sometimes needs. It's also been a good
chance to learn some new tooling, especially
<a href="https://jupyterbook.org">Jupyter Book </a> that handles the assembly of
content in markdown and Jupyter formats into a navigable structure.
I just need to figure out to generate proper PDFs and Epub formats now.</p>

In the past I’ve worked on a range of areas. Some are still of
interest; some not so much; and some are now much more in the
mainstream than they were back in the&nbsp;day.
</p>


<div id="outline-container-org4afb311" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4afb311">Programming&nbsp;languages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4afb311">
<p>
<span class="caps">OK</span>, not so much of a past interest, it’s a current interest that I
don’t have an active research programme in. In another sense, though,
everything I do is about programming languages, or at least about ways
to capture computational processes in a way that’s simple and
accessible to people. At their broadest, programming languages are
about allowing people to express their computational ideas easily, and
that’s something that underpins all computer science&nbsp;research.
</p>

<p>
I’ve developed a number of software systems in the past, including a
system for prototyping programming language interpreters (<a href="/development/projects/vanilla/">Vanilla</a>) and
a modern Forth compiler that we used for experiments in sensor network
programming (<a href="/development/projects/attila">Attila</a>). Both are still available, and may even work on
modern systems: your mileage may&nbsp;vary.

<div id="outline-container-orgd508384" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd508384">High-performance&nbsp;computing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd508384">
<p>
My PhD concerned programming languages for scalable parallel
programming approaches for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transputer">Transputers</a>, a 1980s processor family
that combined processing with four network adaptors for talking to
neighbouring Transputers. They were intended to be constructed as 2d
arrays, computing in parallel and exchanging data with their
neighbours. A great idea, but hard to program effectively. We
explored data structures that expanded onto neighbouring machines
naturally as they grew, while being processed in parallel. It was
sort of a generalisation of what later became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">map-reduce</a>.
</p>

<p>
(Despite being very innovative at the time, it proved impossible for
the Transputer to keep up with the advancing speeds of more
traditional processor architectures – not least because they also
had to simultaneously speed-up the interconnect to keep the balance
right. I can still remember when we acquired an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RS/6000"><span class="caps">IBM</span> <span class="caps">RS</span>/6000</a>
workstation and realised the extent to which it blew the performance
of our 32-Transputer array out of the water, without needing any special
programming&nbsp;techniques.)
</p>

<p>
I did a postdoc that similarly looked at programming language
solutions for high-performance computing, re-visiting the idea
parallel computing based around data types as part of a project
called <a href="https://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/cisd/literature/atlas/p005.htm#s5">TallShiP</a>. We managed to get these structures (&#8220;shared
abstract data types&#8221; or SADTs) to perform efficiently on
workstations and supercomputers by weakening the memory consistency
model in type-specific&nbsp;ways.

<div id="outline-container-org87693f6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org87693f6">Autonomic&nbsp;computing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org87693f6">
<p>
Making large computer systems more manageable involves improving the
ways in which they model and control their own behaviour in response
to changing conditions. I worked a lot on whole-system models of
adaptive behaviour, which eventually narrowed into an interest in
managing sensor&nbsp;systems.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8450f9b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8450f9b">Pervasive&nbsp;computing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8450f9b">
<p>
Another topic that’s still of interest, although perhaps not in a
mainstream way. I used to work on assisted living and other
applications of pervasive systems; now I focus on situation
recognition, which — while it’s a technique with deep applications in
pervasive systems — is somewhat broader and can be applied to all
aspects of data science and sensing. Essentially we don’t care where
the data comes from when interpreting it, so we can look at the deeper
algorithmic issues rather than just the&nbsp;applications.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org266cb99" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org266cb99">Distributed and web&nbsp;systems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org266cb99">
<p>
I got into the web early, including putting up one of the first really
large-scale web servers backed by a database and a content manager
(before “content manager” was a thing). Many of the techniques we
looked at back then (in the mid-1990’s) have since morphed into the
mainstream, in radically different (and mainly better) forms to the
ways we envisioned&nbsp;them.

# simondobson.org

This is the repository for my personal web site,
[https://simondobson.org](https://simondobson.org). This is a static
site built using the [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) site builder. Old
content is written in markdown and reStructured text: new content is
managed using [Emacs org mode](https://orgmode.org/) via a plugin to
match the rest of my note-taking and writing workflow without having
to re-write older stuff.

    &lt;p&gt;
      How dinosaurs drove the development of the theory of evolution – and a lot more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard to credit that the first dinosaurs were only discovered at the end of the 18th century. They emerged into a world that had little doubt about the literal truth of biblical creation. They helped to shatter that certainty, although not alone and not at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book that itself shatters several myths. It shows how Victorian scientists were as religious as their fellow citizens – and often more so – and how their faith coloured their interpretations of the evidence they themselves were discovering. It describes a Darwin too afraid of the possible social consequences ot publish his theories of natural selection as they are formed, and indeed he doesn't publish them until he's slowly built up his reputation as a naturalist through more traditional means: a level of patience that would be unthinkable today. And it shows that his interactions with Alfred Russel Wallace – often described as his rival – were marked by kindness and high regard on both sides, with Wallace modestly content in taking a supporting role (and later being a pallbearer at Darwin's interrment in Westminster Abbey).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the source of the 19th century the religious certainties are challenged successfully, but there was nothing inevitable about the triumph and the opponents absolutely did not go quietly. Atheism remained the last taboo: long after Catholics and non-confirmist Protestants had their civil and political rights restored, atheists still had to fight to be allowed to take seats in Parliament. Taylor presents this as part of the conflict driven by the dinosaurs and the scientific changes their discovery drove, and it's hard to argue with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some fascinating vignettes. My favourite is when Alfred Russel Wallace takes a bet to show the earth is not flat, and devises an ingenious method that of course doesn't rely on any modern technology or arguments, but which is self-evidently correct. That there are still many flat-earthers even today is testament to the abiding need to keep pressing for science and evidence in public life.

      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A playful biography of one of the most creative mathematicians of modern times.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Both the title and sub-title are plays on words, which I'm sure Conway himself enjoyed. He is seen here as a genius playing with ideas, but his genius manifested itself through games, of which he was a prolific inventor; he was curious about everything he encountered, but was also unusual in the ways in which his mind approached challenges and indeed in what he saw &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard to read that Conway ended up hating his best-known invention, the Game of Life, when it's been so influential on mathematicians, computer scientists, and the public at large. He saw it as the least amongst his discoveries, and indeed that's an opinion that's hard to fault: his discoveries in number theory, group theory, game theory, and other fields have been hugely influential, and each alone would have justified his fame. But they were also so technical as to be confined to a narrow group of specialists even within those specialist fields, whereas Life has achieved a life of its own in the popular imagination, it's only real rival being the Mandelbrot set. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Conway who emerges here would, I think, have been enormous fun to know and talk with – as long as you didn't actually have to work with him or get anything from him, in which case he would be a frustrating and unpredictable collaborator. His several books were written with collaborators who needed patience to deal with him and get him to finish his commitments: they probably only hung-in with him because of a determination to give him the credit he was due. (It's interesting that two collaborators once dealt with this by removing him as a co-author and instead putting his name in the paper's title!) He was similarly unpredictable as a speaker, sometimes incredbly charismatic and sometimes failing terribly due to lack of preparation: never a sighn of someone who cares about their audience, although he clearly &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; care desperately, at least sometimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conway's was a talent that the scientific world needs, not content to stay with a single field but contributing widely and thereby bringing his wider expertise to bear on problems that might otherwise have remained unexplored. There's a confidence in such an approach that's sometimes hard to summon-up in today's academia, which rewards increasigly incremental contributions of increasingly narrow depth. Conway was aware of this, but chose (or felt compelled by his own nature) to ignore it, and that's admirable in itself.

    &lt;p&gt;
      If you love mediaeval illumination, this book is a feast. It covers a huge period, focusing mainly on the 14th and 15th centuries, discussing manuscripts collected together by broad themes: love stories, bestiaries, histories, and the like. In the process it also elaborates the underlying stories, so that the illumination makes sense. A lot of these are intricate and deserving whole books in themselves (which many have had, of course): different manuscripts use different variants of the same underlying myths. I was unfamiliar with most of the detail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's the illustrations that are the jewels, of course. Westwell works at the British Library, and so has access to one of the world's largest collections of illuminated manuscripts. The individual letters, borders, and marginal drawings are a complete joy to explore, often with several manuscripts on a common theme set side by side to show the evolution of style and the ways in which the illuminators were thinking about their subjects. Together with the often rude and/or surreal images common to the period, this is a book I will be coming back t time and again.

	Sara Lodge
	  (2024)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      An popular distillation of a deep study of the literature and history of female detectives in fact and fiction. (Full disclosure: Lodge is a colleague of mine at St Andrews, although we've never met.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The genesis of the book comes from Lodge reading two fictional accounts of lady detectives written in 1862: what suddenly brought this about? She discovers a rich seam of "dime" or "penny dreadful" novels that feature lady sleuths as protagonists, as well as – less well-known umtil now – an enormous number of plays that were performed to large audiences. A further search of newspaper archives reveals that private investigation agencies (which proliferated after the wider legalisation of divorce in the mid 19th century) often boasted of employing female detectives – the profession that overlaps considerably with that of actress, with both requiring creativity and confidence. (There is also considerable overlap with sex work.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most revealing observations in this book are the way it interprets the interactions of detectives with class, gender, and other social identities. While fictional lady detectives were middle class and solved complex middle-class crimes, in reality lady detectives were more typically working class and engaged in finding material to support a divorce or supporting the prosection of working-class crimes like fortune-telling. Many were wives of police officers, and were often mothers – or were presented as such in the press in order to make them more sympathetic. Some became quite well-known either through their own accomplishments or by being reported by (typically) male writers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many, both fictional and real, lived lives that sat outside the usually strict gender expectations, making them both useful examples for early suffragettes and aspirational figures for those who felt trapped in their positions. Some were clearly gay. But in good Victorian tradition the fictional female detectives frequently ended the book married (often to an intellectually outclassed husband), with the normal social order restored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all this is an accessible presentation of work that's full of academic rigour and a deep knowledge of the literature, press, and vernacular of the time. It certainly a book that makes me want to read some of the authors mentioned, few of whom (with the exception of Wilkie Collins) have any modern visibility at all.

	  (2016)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The early history of the SAS, told with lots of references to the soldiers' own recollections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard to imagine now how revolutionary David Stirling's ideas were in the 1940s. To remove warefare from the structured set-pieces of the First World War and replace them with a more fluid form that emphasised small strike teams causing havoc behind the recognised front lines, and forcing the enemy to respond by taking troops away from the main battles, was revolutionary. It's hardly surprising that it was fiercely contested within the military – or that it suffered failures ranging from catastrophic to hilarious on the way to its final success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The characters who emerged were clearly unsuited to structured military life, while at the same time being ideally suited to unstructured raiding. The fact that they managed to cohere as a unit is a massive tribute to David (and Bill) stirling, Paddy Mayne, and the other visionary officers and men in the early cadres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most interesting thing for me in this book was how much the war, and the SAS' perception of it, changed over time: from the desert to the countryside and towns of France and Germany, as the war became more vicious and close-quarter. Macintyre doesn't shy-away from reporting behaviours that would nowadays, in retrospect, be regarded as war crimes, from both sides: something that's not been dealt with thoroughly until quite recently in the histories of the Second World War. None of that changes or tarnishes the heroism on show: in many ways it serves to highlight the times when the officers in charge chose to act scrupulously, to consciously differentiate themselves from their enemy.

	  (1996)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The autobiography of a drug dealer, and it's captivating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Howard Marks went from being an Oxford student, to an Oxford academic, to being an international hashish smuggler. Not the world's largest, as his eventual indictment in America had it, but certainly on an epic scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of the story is quite humdrum, interesting only as background to Marks' own development and personal life. But there are some amazing anecdotes, such as shipping dope into America in the speaker cabinets of rock bands who are actually just stoners recruited to play a part – and then realising that US border control isn't full of rock fans and so won't realise that there isn't actually a band to go with the equipment. Cue some made-up rock bands doing imaginary tours. No-one notices for ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a lot of mythologising, of course. Most of the story takes place as dialogue, and there are some very intricate travel arrangements as he flies around the world doing deals. Is this all true? – either Marks has a photographic memory, or he kept a detailed diary (risky for a drug smuggler), or the details have been imagined from a broader recollection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually he's caught, of course: arrested in Spain, the victim of an enormous and legally questionable operation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Marks has no time for the DEA agents, regards them as rigid and vicious. He skewers the US legal system and its arbitrariness, as well as its moralising while fixating on admission of guilt: an almost religious insistence that the victim admit and repent even when this means admitting to a crime purely in order to then be immediately released, with everyone involved knowing how fake the whole scanario is. Evidence is lost, faked, and dubiously interpreted, creating order and conspiracy where he sees accident and opportunism. He likens it, very persuasively, to the Soviet and Chinese purges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard to know how accurate any of this is in terms of the historical record. But as the story of an outlaw with his own morality and a willingness to help others, it's quite fascinating.

      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A history of a forgotten company from what seems like a radically different time. The company, Simulmatics, essentially invented the field of data science applied to social sciences, and tried to apply these ideas to advertising, warfare, and law enforcement. Sound familiar?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's probably unsurprising that Simulmatics is forgotten: it was barely ever a functional company, and would perhaps never have achieved even the limited results it did without the quagmire of the Vietnam War giving license to all sorts of unusual and even desperate ideas in the pursuit of a way out for the US – &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; way out. It doesn't work out. Perhaps it could &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; have worked at that time, given the limitations of computing power and data availability, but there's a weird unwillingness to properly engage with the funded projects, partly because of attitudes of the time preventing senior staff from engaging in field work, or with working computers, or working as equals with the women and local interpreters they hired – all of whom could have helped make sense of the situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's impossible not to read Simulmatics as a precursor to other trends too: to over-promising and under-delivering, to radically hyping-up every small incremental improvement in technology, to generalising from tiny successes to society-changing possibilities. Lepore sees this as leading directly to modern Silicon Valley techno-utopianism, and it's hard to disagree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a feeling at the time that predictive analytics was &lt;i&gt;ipso facto&lt;/i&gt; anti-democratic and even immoral. I suspect the reality is slightly more nuanced than this, and that the problems start when the prediction becomes a lever to enforce (or avoid) a particular outcome. It may not matter whether the people with their hands on the lever are government or companies, conservative or liberal; it may not matter that the lever has only a very limited power to move opinions. Understanding social trends slides very easily into manipulating them in pursuit of a specific goal, which may not be transparent to those meing manipulated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conclusion nails many of the defining features of the early 21st century that emerge directly from Simulmatics' techniques, even when they remain unacknowledged. They also skewer the techno-optimism, emerging in part from the 60s counterculture, that led directly to some of today's problems. By using data to personalise people's exposure to information and comment, and by simplifying who could become a journalist and publisher, the internet and the web encouraged atomisation and the emergence of communities never exposed to contrary ideas: everyone gets their own facts alongside having their own opinions re-affirmed. It's definitely the major social challenge of our times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the conclusions are marred slightly by their purely American focus. It's true that the &lt;i&gt;US government&lt;/i&gt; declined to regulate data collection and processing by private companies, but not true that &lt;i&gt;governments&lt;/i&gt; declined: the EU's General Data Protection Regulations do precisely this, however imperfectly, and if there is a be a solution to the widespread abuses of big data then those (and similar) regulations will play a large part.

    &lt;p&gt;
      An amusing and informative study of corpses. Not a sentence I ever expected to write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book that digs into both the biology and the sociology of how we treat the dead. This includes the various uses made of cadavers over the year, from modern medical education to potions and "cures" made from mummies. Along the way we also get a discussion of different funeral practices being proposed by generations of free-thinkers and how they do (and don't) get adopted by wider society. In many ways it's amazing the the taboo against dissection and associated practices was &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; overcome: it seems to be an almost universal belief that the dead should be disposed of whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the content is fascinating, the writing style grates on me. I understand the need for some levity in dealing with a topic that has the potential to be offensive or distressing in equal means – but I wish Roach could have resisted the temptation to quip every third paragraph (it feels like). It feels forced.

      The modern history of a nation that's been to some extent marginalised by wider geopolitics. It begins with domination by Japan in the late 19th century, which continued until the end of the Second World War – only to be replaced by domination through "trusteeship" by the US and others, which itself was a direct precursor to the partition of the nation, a vicious war, and a long and convoluted evolution of two very different political and economic outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are times when it feels a little superficial: the Korean War gets only a few pages. But that's a consequence of the breadth of coverage, and especially the time spent analysing the politics as they evolve through repression (in the North) and authoritarianism becoming dictatorship and finally vibrant and raucous democracy (in the South).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that both authors are Korea specialists (and in one case ethnically Korean) certainly helps. They have seen close-up the evolution of both Koreas' places in the world, and their personal observations and anecdotes bring the story alive without being distracting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last chapter is a detailed analysis of when and whether any re-unification of the pennisula will happen. It's a balanced and well-informed view, albeit one that's too sanguine with respect to the expectation of continued US support and engagement: the recent (as I write) events in Ukraine don't give confidence in whether the US would act as an honest broker in any crisis. But it remains a clear and well-reasoned (if largely non-committal) analysis of where Krean history may go next.

	Naomi Klein
	  (2023)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What does it mean for someone to have a double? That is the broad premise of this book, and its a lot broader than it first appears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klein's doppelganger is another author, Naomi Wolf. Both began as liberal and feminist darlings, before "Other Naomi" (Wolf) became a proponent of various consipracy theories and hanging out with right-wing influencers. The two Naomis starte being confused with each other within social media, to the estent that Klein almost starts to lose her own sense of identity and becomes increasingly obsessed with tracking the confusion. (I was darkly amused to check Wolf out on &lt;a&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and find that the page starts "Not to be confused with Naomi Klein" – and &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt; for Klein's entry.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a certain feeling of narcissism in the account. Maybe Klein is affected so much because she and Wolf both have such curated on-line personalities, so that when Klein's is intruded upon it feels like a personal attack. Would someone with less commitment to media be so affected? – well, I have to say I hope I never personally find out, because it comes across as a very destabilising experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klein does take a broader view of the pheonomenon of "doubling", which at one level feels unnecessary ad extraneous to this book but that I found quite fascinating in its own right: the idea that doubles appear in lots of circumstances for those with (and even without) a life in the public eye. For an author it's natural to be worried about how the "double" that is one's written work is interpreted and re-interpreted after it's been published, without your control, and how this spills-back on to how people interpret everything you write from then on. Some of the examples feel a little contrived, others quite plausible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this book is both a personal memoir and a deeper exploration of a person's relationship to their own work and life. Both sides are valuable and well worth reading.

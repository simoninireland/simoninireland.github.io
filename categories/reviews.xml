	Sara Lodge
	  (2024)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      An popular distillation of a deep study of the literature and history of female detectives in fact and fiction. (Full disclosure: Lodge is a colleague of mine at St Andrews, although we've never met.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The genesis of the book comes from Lodge reading two fictional accounts of lady detectives written in 1862: what suddenly brought this about? She discovers a rich seam of "dime" or "penny dreadful" novels that feature lady sleuths as protagonists, as well as – less well-known umtil now – an enormous number of plays that were performed to large audiences. A further search of newspaper archives reveals that private investigation agencies (which proliferated after the wider legalisation of divorce in the mid 19th century) often boasted of employing female detectives – the profession that overlaps considerably with that of actress, with both requiring creativity and confidence. (There is also considerable overlap with sex work.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most revealing observations in this book are the way it interprets the interactions of detectives with class, gender, and other social identities. While fictional lady detectives were middle class and solved complex middle-class crimes, in reality lady detectives were more typically working class and engaged in finding material to support a divorce or supporting the prosection of working-class crimes like fortune-telling. Many were wives of police officers, and were often mothers – or were presented as such in the press in order to make them more sympathetic. Some became quite well-known either through their own accomplishments or by being reported by (typically) male writers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many, both fictional and real, lived lives that sat outside the usually strict gender expectations, making them both useful examples for early suffragettes and aspirational figures for those who felt trapped in their positions. Some were clearly gay. But in good Victorian tradition the fictional female detectives frequently ended the book married (often to an intellectually outclassed husband), with the normal social order restored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all this is an accessible presentation of work that's full of academic rigour and a deep knowledge of the literature, press, and vernacular of the time. It certainly a book that makes me want to read some of the authors mentioned, few of whom (with the exception of Wilkie Collins) have any modern visibility at all.

	  (2016)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The early history of the SAS, told with lots of references to the soldiers' own recollections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard to imagine now how revolutionary David Stirling's ideas were in the 1940s. To remove warefare from the structured set-pieces of the First World War and replace them with a more fluid form that emphasised small strike teams causing havoc behind the recognised front lines, and forcing the enemy to respond by taking troops away from the main battles, was revolutionary. It's hardly surprising that it was fiercely contested within the military – or that it suffered failures ranging from catastrophic to hilarious on the way to its final success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The characters who emerged were clearly unsuited to structured military life, while at the same time being ideally suited to unstructured raiding. The fact that they managed to cohere as a unit is a massive tribute to David (and Bill) stirling, Paddy Mayne, and the other visionary officers and men in the early cadres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most interesting thing for me in this book was how much the war, and the SAS' perception of it, changed over time: from the desert to the countryside and towns of France and Germany, as the war became more vicious and close-quarter. Macintyre doesn't shy-away from reporting behaviours that would nowadays, in retrospect, be regarded as war crimes, from both sides: something that's not been dealt with thoroughly until quite recently in the histories of the Second World War. None of that changes or tarnishes the heroism on show: in many ways it serves to highlight the times when the officers in charge chose to act scrupulously, to consciously differentiate themselves from their enemy.

	Howard Marks
	  (1996)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The autobiography of a drug dealer, and it's captivating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Howard Marks went from being an Oxford student, to an Oxford academic, to being an international hashish smuggler. Not the world's largest, as his eventual indictment in America had it, but certainly on an epic scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of the story is quite humdrum, interesting only as background to Marks' own development and personal life. But there are some amazing anecdotes, such as shipping dope into America in the speaker cabinets of rock bands who are actually just stoners recruited to play a part – and then realising that US border control isn't full of rock fans and so won't realise that there isn't actually a band to go with the equipment. Cue some made-up rock bands doing imaginary tours. No-one notices for ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a lot of mythologising, of course. Most of the story takes place as dialogue, and there are some very intricate travel arrangements as he flies around the world doing deals. Is this all true? – either Marks has a photographic memory, or he kept a detailed diary (risky for a drug smuggler), or the details have been imagined from a broader recollection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually he's caught, of course: arrested in Spain, the victim of an enormous and legally questionable operation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Marks has no time for the DEA agents, regards them as rigid and vicious. He skewers the US legal system and its arbitrariness, as well as its moralising while fixating on admission of guilt: an almost religious insistence that the victim admit and repent even when this means admitting to a crime purely in order to then be immediately released, with everyone involved knowing how fake the whole scanario is. Evidence is lost, faked, and dubiously interpreted, creating order and conspiracy where he sees accident and opportunism. He likens it, very persuasively, to the Soviet and Chinese purges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard to know how accurate any of this is in terms of the historical record. But as the story of an outlaw with his own morality and a willingness to help others, it's quite fascinating.

      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A history of a forgotten company from what seems like a radically different time. The company, Simulmatics, essentially invented the field of data science applied to social sciences, and tried to apply these ideas to advertising, warfare, and law enforcement. Sound familiar?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's probably unsurprising that Simulmatics is forgotten: it was barely ever a functional company, and would perhaps never have achieved even the limited results it did without the quagmire of the Vietnam War giving license to all sorts of unusual and even desperate ideas in the pursuit of a way out for the US – &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; way out. It doesn't work out. Perhaps it could &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; have worked at that time, given the limitations of computing power and data availability, but there's a weird unwillingness to properly engage with the funded projects, partly because of attitudes of the time preventing senior staff from engaging in field work, or with working computers, or working as equals with the women and local interpreters they hired – all of whom could have helped make sense of the situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's impossible not to read Simulmatics as a precursor to other trends too: to over-promising and under-delivering, to radically hyping-up every small incremental improvement in technology, to generalising from tiny successes to society-changing possibilities. Lepore sees this as leading directly to modern Silicon Valley techno-utopianism, and it's hard to disagree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a feeling at the time that predictive analytics was &lt;i&gt;ipso facto&lt;/i&gt; anti-democratic and even immoral. I suspect the reality is slightly more nuanced than this, and that the problems start when the prediction becomes a lever to enforce (or avoid) a particular outcome. It may not matter whether the people with their hands on the lever are government or companies, conservative or liberal; it may not matter that the lever has only a very limited power to move opinions. Understanding social trends slides very easily into manipulating them in pursuit of a specific goal, which may not be transparent to those meing manipulated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conclusion nails many of the defining features of the early 21st century that emerge directly from Simulmatics' techniques, even when they remain unacknowledged. They also skewer the techno-optimism, emerging in part from the 60s counterculture, that led directly to some of today's problems. By using data to personalise people's exposure to information and comment, and by simplifying who could become a journalist and publisher, the internet and the web encouraged atomisation and the emergence of communities never exposed to contrary ideas: everyone gets their own facts alongside having their own opinions re-affirmed. It's definitely the major social challenge of our times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the conclusions are marred slightly by their purely American focus. It's true that the &lt;i&gt;US government&lt;/i&gt; declined to regulate data collection and processing by private companies, but not true that &lt;i&gt;governments&lt;/i&gt; declined: the EU's General Data Protection Regulations do precisely this, however imperfectly, and if there is a be a solution to the widespread abuses of big data then those (and similar) regulations will play a large part.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      An amusing and informative study of corpses. Not a sentence I ever expected to write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book that digs into both the biology and the sociology of how we treat the dead. This includes the various uses made of cadavers over the year, from modern medical education to potions and "cures" made from mummies. Along the way we also get a discussion of different funeral practices being proposed by generations of free-thinkers and how they do (and don't) get adopted by wider society. In many ways it's amazing the the taboo against dissection and associated practices was &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; overcome: it seems to be an almost universal belief that the dead should be disposed of whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the content is fascinating, the writing style grates on me. I understand the need for some levity in dealing with a topic that has the potential to be offensive or distressing in equal means – but I wish Roach could have resisted the temptation to quip every third paragraph (it feels like). It feels forced.

    &lt;p&gt;
      The modern history of a nation that's been to some extent marginalised by wider geopolitics. It begins with domination by Japan in the late 19th century, which continued until the end of the Second World War – only to be replaced by domination through "trusteeship" by the US and others, which itself was a direct precursor to the partition of the nation, a vicious war, and a long and convoluted evolution of two very different political and economic outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are times when it feels a little superficial: the Korean War gets only a few pages. But that's a consequence of the breadth of coverage, and especially the time spent analysing the politics as they evolve through repression (in the North) and authoritarianism becoming dictatorship and finally vibrant and raucous democracy (in the South).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that both authors are Korea specialists (and in one case ethnically Korean) certainly helps. They have seen close-up the evolution of both Koreas' places in the world, and their personal observations and anecdotes bring the story alive without being distracting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last chapter is a detailed analysis of when and whether any re-unification of the pennisula will happen. It's a balanced and well-informed view, albeit one that's too sanguine with respect to the expectation of continued US support and engagement: the recent (as I write) events in Ukraine don't give confidence in whether the US would act as an honest broker in any crisis. But it remains a clear and well-reasoned (if largely non-committal) analysis of where Krean history may go next.

	Naomi Klein
	  (2023)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What does it mean for someone to have a double? That is the broad premise of this book, and its a lot broader than it first appears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klein's doppelganger is another author, Naomi Wolf. Both began as liberal and feminist darlings, before "Other Naomi" (Wolf) became a proponent of various consipracy theories and hanging out with right-wing influencers. The two Naomis starte being confused with each other within social media, to the estent that Klein almost starts to lose her own sense of identity and becomes increasingly obsessed with tracking the confusion. (I was darkly amused to check Wolf out on &lt;a&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and find that the page starts "Not to be confused with Naomi Klein" – and &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt; for Klein's entry.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a certain feeling of narcissism in the account. Maybe Klein is affected so much because she and Wolf both have such curated on-line personalities, so that when Klein's is intruded upon it feels like a personal attack. Would someone with less commitment to media be so affected? – well, I have to say I hope I never personally find out, because it comes across as a very destabilising experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klein does take a broader view of the pheonomenon of "doubling", which at one level feels unnecessary ad extraneous to this book but that I found quite fascinating in its own right: the idea that doubles appear in lots of circumstances for those with (and even without) a life in the public eye. For an author it's natural to be worried about how the "double" that is one's written work is interpreted and re-interpreted after it's been published, without your control, and how this spills-back on to how people interpret everything you write from then on. Some of the examples feel a little contrived, others quite plausible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this book is both a personal memoir and a deeper exploration of a person's relationship to their own work and life. Both sides are valuable and well worth reading.

	Stuart Russell
	  (2019)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A book that tries to address the emergence and implications of artificial intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I should preface what I'm going to say by noting Brand's enormous contributions to AI research and teaching. He knows massively more about these systems than I do.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Computer scientists often avoid the term "AI" because it's so broad and encompasses a huge range of approaches, from constraint-solving and pattern-matching to speech recognition and the sorts of "chatbot" technology that is the common face of modern AI – technically referred to as Large Language Models or LLMs, that have been trained on text scraped from the internet and can perform impressive feats of conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a problem when discussing AI that you have to be very careful about, and that's the tendency to anthropomorphise. It's almost impossble not to use terms that imply agency: "think", "understand", "learn", "know", "decide", and so on. AI researchers use these words with very technical senses that are analogous to their usual meanings – but that aren't the same, and that's where things get misleading. When a person "summarises" some information, we mean that they pick out what they think is most important from the text; when an LLM does the same thing, it picks out the words that are statistically most clustered within the text and its training data. Are these two processes the same? They certainly don't &lt;i&gt;sound&lt;/i&gt; the same, and they often produce radically different "summaries", because the human summariser is working from a far richer knowledge base and using different means to assess importance, often including what they know about the intended audience. It's doing this well that's usually taken as one of the hallmarks of intelligence. These are statistical techniques that cleave to the mean, which implies they will always &lt;i&gt;by design&lt;/i&gt; produce middling answers. An amazingly insightful and creative answer is by definition unlikely, and so will be avoided &lt;i&gt;by design&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other problems too. Machine learning, the science that underlies LLMs, is usually based on training from huge volumes of data. This permits impressive feats, such as being able to spot anomalies in cancer images better (in some cases) and more consistently than trained doctors. But that's a weakness too: the idea that &lt;i&gt;the future will be like the past&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that anything not in the training set runs the risk of being ignored as noise. The LLMs' training data from the internet is &lt;i&gt;text&lt;/i&gt;, not validated &lt;i&gt;knowledge&lt;/i&gt; in any sense. And remember that repetition increases likelihood for an LLM, including repeatition of nonsense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This lies at the heart of the problem of hallucination, where AIs confidently produce startlingly incorrect text. Why is this? Because text is all they have to work with: there is no model of the world as it is, and therefore no ability to correct. The most modern LLMs are now attempting to correct this, so far with little success. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So are we seeing intelligence from LLMs? We're seeing something that &lt;i&gt;presents&lt;/i&gt; like &lt;i&gt;some parts of&lt;/i&gt; such intelligence. From this the industry has extrapolated that we are, for example, about to see models demonstrating "PhD level" ability – "soon", but there never seems to be a demonstration. One characteristic of LLMs is that they don't spontaneously do &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;: they wait until prompted, and then reply. Does that sound like intelligent behaviour? – no planning, no forethought, no imagination? I work with a lot of PhD-level people, and &lt;i&gt;none of them&lt;/i&gt; behave this way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some will object that there's lots going on in industrial labs that we don't see. Quite possibly. Maybe the insiders are seeing things that we outsiders don't. But the common characteristic of the systems we outsiders &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; see is systems that can perform well on certain well-prescribed and -bounded tasks, but which then fail catastrophically when used in less constrained domains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am a materialist: I don't believe that there's anything supernatural about intelligence (however one defines it), or anything privileged about running an intelligent process on a biological (rather than a silicon) substrate. But this book strikes me as another over-hyped, somewhat confused and confusing contribution to our understanding of what AI is. It focuses on some entirely hypothetical potential harms (intelligent autonomous machines) while largely ignoring the very real current harms of bias, accuracy, and increasing economic and digital disparities.

      A deeply creative world-building novel that builds a city protected by magic in a world that's clearly set against it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a novel in a style that doesn't explain its premises but lets the reader infer what's happening from the details of the small-scale presentation. In this it's not always entirely successful, and even by the end there are a lot of loose ends – which I suppose set the stage for the sequel.

      A biography of a much-romanticised Russian spy. Sorge spied on Japan while working for the Nazis while working for the Soviets. His fame rests on his determination of the date of Pearl Harbour (which Stalin didn't pass on to the Americans), and his confirmation that Japan would not attack the Russian East (which Stalin was slow to believe) that allowed the Red Army to transfer a huge number of troops to fight and defeat the Wehrmacht at the gates of Stalingrad: one of the battles that decisively determined the outcome of the Second World War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was clearly a complex and troubled man, as many spies are. His cover as a hard-drinking womaniser wasn't much of an act, and he spent Moscow's money freely to keep in character. But he was also very badly served by his handlers, routinely disbelieved and threatened with the Stalinist purges, and sent a succession of inept collaborators. His commitment to Communism was sufficient to ride-out these challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would have liked to have read more about his "afterlife" in press and politics: it's only covered briefly here, but there's clearly a lot to be learned from his later rehabilitation and promotion as a Soviet idealist.

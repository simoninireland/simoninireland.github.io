    &lt;p&gt;
      The space race from the American perspective is well-known: this book presents the same race from the Soviet perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The differences are profound, of course, mainly driven by the Soviet programme occurring in complete secrecy to duck the risks that failure would have on the programme's image. The American programme by contrast was conducted in the open at least as far as the actual "shots" were concerned – and their public failures did indeed endanger their ability to continue, at least in part because neither public nor politicians understood the process of engineering or just how &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt; each shot was. The deep irony is that the Soviet successes appeared so sudden and dramatic they led directly to the deepening of the American programme and commitment or more money and effort than the Soviets seemed able to maintain to capitalise on their early lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are plenty of revelations even for those with a detailed interest in space history. I remember hearing all through the 1970s that the Soviet spacecraft landed on land, but it turns out that in many cases the cosmonauts were bailing-out and parachuting to earth instead, with this being intensively covered-up even to the extent of falsifying reports to the international organisation responsible for certifying "firsts" in space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the achievements of both programmes were profound, they were perhaps doomed in the long term by a lack of vision for what they were actually &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;. The benefits of space technology are now obvious; those of exploration perhaps less so, although it doesn't (in my opinion) require much suspension of disbelief to feel that science-driven activities lead almost inevitably to enormously valuable spin-offs. The fact that we can't quantify these &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; shouldn't (in my opinion, again) stop us keeping the faith in the value of experiments that advance our science &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; engineering in ways that wouldn't otherwise happen.

    &lt;p&gt;
      A very technical examination of the world's first numerical weather "prediction" – although in fact it was really a "postdiction", taking detailed data and using it to compute a scenario that could be compared against a known ground truth. It was an incredible achievement anyway, performing manually and at low resolution the calculations now routinely performed by computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richardson was the person who saw that this would be possible, realising that the physics and mathematics could be solved even though the computational capabilities didn't exist. In this he foresaw the emergence of the modern power of data, where the existence of more and better data transforms both the way we do science and the sciene that we do. It's something that should put him alongside Turing and Von Neumann as visionaries of what computation could achieve.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The history of what is still as I write this an ongoing scandal: perhaps the greatest miscarriage of justice in UK history, when the Post Office turned on and prosecuted its own operators for fraud on the basis of flawed evidence from its Horizon IT system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scandal came from a series of interlocking arrangements. The Post Office could mount prosecutions in its own right (something that its management now claims to have been unaware of), with its own investigators able to interview under caution but seemingly not required to record interviews or allow legal representation. The contracts under which postmasters operated were mis-represented to turn any discrepancies into the postmasters' fault, while simultaneously denying them the data they'd need to investigate themselves unless they were exceptionally careful and persistent – and the few who &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; were prosecuted and driven out anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a computer scientist I have to say that the most ridiculous part of the story is the presumption in law that a computer system works properly absent explicit to the contrary, that – when coupled with an asymmetry of who can access to software and its logs – makes it impossible to fight against computer-generated evidence. No system of this size &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; works flawlessly, and a careful designer would add features on that assumption, such as paper-trails or detailed logs that can then be forensically analysed. Equally, no such system would ever be constructed without remote access to terminal endpoints to allow problems to be remotely fixed, and again a careful designer would ensure that such interventions were logged so as to be auditable. This is so self-evident that I find it hard to believe that Horizon &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt; designed that way, which makes the repeated denials even more suspicious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there's a social commentary here too. The justice system, juries, and the communities of the prosecuted postmasters were almost eager to believe their guilt. Part of that was the lack of proper media scrutiny to bring the extent of prosecutions into the public eye, and part due to obfuscation by the Post Office itself – but it surely there should be systemic oversight of such things, given the massive consequences. And surely communities should have been less ready to believe accusations made against their own members that went against the evidence of their own eyes.

      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It's unusual to read a book that probably couldn't have been written before &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; after it actually was: the political environment of China thawed just enough to give people confidence to speak to a foreign author about the events of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The horrors shine through, in the memories of the young Red Guards and their victims. But so too do the current sensitivities, not least in the rather farcical museums and monuments that can be found across China – but that can't be visited, because the custodians race to close them up "for maintenance" as soon as a visitor arrives. It's a different approach to that described in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50215644.Between_Two_Fires_Truth__Ambition__and_Compromise_in_Putin_s_Russia" title="Between Two Fires Truth, Ambition, and Compromise in Putin's Russia by Joshua Yaffa" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Between Two Fires: Truth, Ambition, and Compromise in Putin's Russia&lt;/a&gt;, where museums are re-assigned to new curators who subtly change their message, but it reinforces the fears that authoritarian regimes have of their own histories and those who might actually remember them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China has never had a public reckoning with the Cultural Revolution – and it doesn't look that it will have one for a long time. The message of this book is that this hiding of the past continues to do damage to the present, not least because it provides a vague and unexamined fear of disorder that can be used to justify repression "in case it happens again". But the fact is that it didn't just "happen": it was commanded, by a regime that's the linear predecessor of the current leadership who seem to want to both disown it &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; levarage it for their own ends.&lt;br&gt;

	  (2016)

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When complimented on his armies capturing Berlin at the end of the Second World War, Stalin famously replied that "Tsar Alexander made it to Paris." This book describes how, and why, that happened – and why it meant to much to Stalin, on whom Sebag Montefirore is of course a recognised expert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sweep of Romanov history is epic in all senses. It's impossible not to realise how deeply &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; their rule was, identifying their own reigns absolutely with Russia and its greatness. The main characters are all flawed in tragic ways, sometimes grotesque but equally often brilliant and self-aware within the limitations of their eras – which none ever really managed to trascend, with the possible exception of Peter and later Catherine, each known as "the Great" for that reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story is made powerful by recent research in the Russian archives and access to previously-unkown letters between Alexander II and his mistress, and later between Nicholas II and Alexandra. They highlight the impact of extra-marital affairs on high policy right across the Romonov era: it's often hard to keep track of who is related to (or sleeping with) whom, or to understand the true importance of some of the less well-known characters in the story who may have have had an advisory impact far beyond what their "official" position might suggest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a book that's hard on autocracy – but also quite hard on the alternatives that came after. Sebag Montefiore sees a continuity between the tsars, Lenin, Stalin, and Putin, and almost seems to regard it as inevitable that Russia will need strongman leadership. One can perhaps hope not.

	  (2022)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A thoughtful look at modelling by an experienced climate modeller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are models &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;? The most common answer would be "to predict the future behaviour of some system," but Thompson argues a far more subtle line: that the most important models often &lt;i&gt;fail&lt;/i&gt; to be predictive in any real sense. Much of this is down to problems of validation, especially in climate models for which we have no experience of the world the models are trying to predict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An even more subtle mistake is regarding all models as "cameras" that simply observe the world. That's true for the more abstract kinds of modelling, where one is trying to understand possible behaviours of systems in general without tying them to specific circumstances. But the models with which most people are familiar act ore like "engines" that can perturb the system they're purporting simply to observe by baing used as drivers for policy. Climate and epidemic models seek to warn as well as predict and understand, but this exacerbates the problems of validation: if the model's predictions &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; come to pass, perhaps this is because policy-makers took corrective actions in response, or maybe bacause they didn't intervent effectively enough. This isn't a reason to give up on modelling altogether: how else are we to understand complex systems, and how else are we to respond rationally to them? But it does mean that the notion of "following the science" problematic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thompson also wrestles with the problem of groupthink amongst modellers, who often share a common overallping background. I agree this is a problem, but the idea that we can increase diversity in the community easily seems flawed to me. Modellers share a scientific viewpoint and a belief in modelling, and no-one who doesn't will ever be able to effectively engage with the models or their arguments. Perhaps it's enough that scientists are always advisors and never decision-makers, and allow politicians to deal with the integration of different choices and values – although that split isn't always appreciated by the public, and is often (as in the covid-19 pandemic) deliberately blurred to allow less-trusted politicians to draw credibility from more-trusted scientists and doctors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall I think this is a lucid and valiant attempt to summarise and explore the benefits and limitations of models, and science in general, when it impacts directly on the wider world. It deserves to be widely read in the scientific community so that we can better understand our place in policies that we often unavoidably have to influence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      An insight into the British politics of the 2010s. And not a pretty sight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pitch for this book is that, as a political wife, the author had a unique ringside seat from which to observe the goings-on the (mostly male) politicians. And it's true that she has plenty of insight into them and into her own position in the circle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she also exposes herself as almost a caricature of a Tory. She accepts the misogyny and crudeness of the male MPs as just how it is, and utterly lacks any understanding of why anyone would disagree with her own positions. She can't accept, for example, that Remainers were sincere and their misgivings might be valid, or that the EU is anything other that fascinated with the idea of humiliating Britain. She constantly refers to the Labour party as "Marxists" and trots-out the usual tropes of how they would bankrupt the country, despite the fact that their "extreme left-wing" positions would be entirely mainstream in many European countries. She's clear-eyed and unenthusiastic about Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, but then fawns over him when he wins his election landslide and glides over the time-bomb he planted on the Irish border issue, even though this was evident at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The overwhelming theme, returned to again and again, is how self-interested the political class is, focused entirely on who's up, who's down, and how if affects their own careers. Lots of dinner parties, gentlemen's clubs, and holidays: one is left amazed by how shallow everyone is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not a bad book, and an enjoyably light read. But politically insightful it isn't, other than to highlight the trivial nature of politicians.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Post-apocalyptic fiction of a determinedly British kind. It's not a bad book, and has a certain complexity to it in exploring how people's attitudes might change when faced with the destruction of normal civilisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A deadly virus destroys all grass-like plants, thereby eliminating almost all food crops and the cattle that they feed. Worried the government might atom-bomb the major population centres, a small group leave London to make their way to a Lake District valley. On the way they encounter looters, towns gone feral to protect themselves – and become feral themselves, willing to kill to survive. In some ways it reads like &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies" title="Lord of the Flies by William Golding" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/a&gt; with adults and a more pervading sense of long-term doom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's also very much a novel of its time, full of racism, sexism, classism, deference, stiff upper lips, and a sense of self-justification wrapped-up as duty. That makes it a hard read, and it doesn't really have enough force to balance that out. Manu similar points are made elsewhere, for example in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93269.Earth_Abides" title="Earth Abides by George R. Stewart" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Earth Abides&lt;/a&gt;, without the 1950s baggage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	Nicole Perlroth
	  (2021)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A hugely detailed and deeply researched history of the market for "zero-day: exploits, the faults and technologies underlying computer viruses and ransomware. It's a hugely complicated and technical field which Perlroth does an amazing job of making accessible to a non-technical audience. (I should probably say here that I teach computer security.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the book is a real page-turner, deeply embedded with the government agencies, companies, and hackers who compose the zero-day market. It's scathing of the US' trying to play both sides of the street, developing and buying zero-days in order to collect intelligence while weakening the security of ordinary users in the process by not informing the software developers of the problems they've found. They clearly knew this was dangerous, and even developed a doctrine for us: "NOBUS", bugs that "no-one but us" would be smart enough to find or develop. This idea goes wrong spectacularly, as other nations realise how cheaply they too can have cyberweapons programmes: ironically they're encouraged by the deployment of the Stuxnet virus to damage the Iranian nuclear programme. The leaks of the NSA's zero-day stockpile by the Shadow Brokers – an event that's somewhat under-explored – and their later use in hacks against US elections, are payback for hubris.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perlroth is scathing of the Trump presidency's neglect of cybersecurity and unwillingness to sanction Russia for known attacks – in part because it might cast doubt on Trump's legitimacy as an elected president, but also seemingly from willful blindness and a mistrust of the professionals (including the military) tasked with protecting US networks. She was writing during the pandemic and before Trump conceded the 2020 election (to the extent that he ever did), and so if anything she understated the impacts of disinformation spreading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conclusions are a little breathless, but well-intentioned and technically appropriate, if a little US-centric – and in fairness the US has at least attempted to set up a more transparent approach to managing cyberweapons, even though the approach is drastically compromised by the desire to keep intelligence-gathering capabilities. Cybersecurity is an area where offence and defence are closely intertwined, and there's a strong argument that the costs to society of the former mandate a focus on the latter. We need to accept that many cyberweapons that are used (or leaked) can be reverse-engineered and re-used against their original developers with little real up-front financial investment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's some editing. including a repeated mis-use of "affect" rather than "effect", and a really disastrous throw-away reference to the book &lt;i&gt;Dune&lt;/i&gt;, the description of which is almost entirely wrong: surely an editor should have picked that up?

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A book that combines food with economics? Not really.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm torn by this book. I enjoyed the food parts, especially the author's anecdotes about his move to the UK from Korea, and how he's observed the UK's food scene change from incredibly insular and conservative to amazingly open and dynamic over the course of a couple of decades. It's a change I also lived through and remember well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also enjoyed the economics. Chang is an eclectic collector of economic theories – all the more surprising because he's an academic. He has an appropriate degree of scepticism for ideology and single explanation of complex questions, which is refreshing. He skewers some of the common myths, such as the "explanation" that poor countreis stay poor because their people don't work hard enough, ingoring the massive structural factors in play. He's equally scathing about the other "explanation" about the free-trade roots of the successes of the US and UK economies, given that they were actually massively protectionist during their main periods of growth. And he makes several policy suggestions for modern economies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But.... as a book, I don't think it works at all. The conceit of explaining economics through food remains just that: a conceit that's not really threaded through the narrative in a meaningful way. The links are often just too tenuous. To give one example, a chapter that leads with anchovies ends up talking about natural-resource extraction economics using the example of bird guano – well, birds eat anchovies, so... Most of the chapters are basically diviided between food and economics with an often desperate attempt to tie them together. The economics is accessible, and a writer who can do that probably doesn't need a gimmick to structure his work.

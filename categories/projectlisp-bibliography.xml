Programmers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Leanpub. 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not convinced by the sub-title: at the very least, there's no
evidence to support the claim that Lisp programmers really are
hundreds of time more productive. But there are some serious
insights here from individuals who've made serious contributions
to the Lisp world – and beyond. The contributions all take the
form of email interviews consisting of a standard prelude of
questions (how did you discover Lisp?, do you use it at work?)
followed by a couple of questions tailored to the interviewee.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The practitioners selected have all been affected by Lisp, either
in terms of it changing their own thought processes, or by helping
to develop the core ecosystem, or by applying Lisp to real-world
problems, and often to great effect. My favourite was the
discussion with someone who was using Common Lisp to develop
low-latency network routing for financial services: it's hard
to think of a better example of Lisp's power and range.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html"&gt;My Lisp Experiences and the Development of GNU Emacs&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The never-dull Richard Stallman talks about his experiences with
Lisp and with the development of Emacs. It's got some useful
observations on &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; Lisp became the core of Emacs: it was news to
me that this hadn't always been the case. It started with an
"editor control" language in the spirit of editors like &lt;code&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;. But as
people wanted more support from their editor, they wanted to
program it more effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The language that you build your extensions on shouldn't be
thought of as a programming language in afterthought; it should be
designed as a programming language. In fact, we discovered that
the best programming language for that purpose was Lisp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The result was a re-write of Emacs in C (for portability), with a
Lisp interpreter specialised towards editing tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He then gives an insider's perspective on the Lisp machines and
their evolution, as well as revealing the genesis of his ideas for
the free software movement. While these are interesting to read,
it should be noted that much of it has been rebutted: his
description of the formation and later history of the two
spin-outs, Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc, is strongly disputed
by Dan Weinreb on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090101103828/http://danweinreb.org/blog/rebuttal-to-stallmans-story-about-the-formation-of-symbolics-and-lmi"&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;.)

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fytGL8vzGeQ"&gt;How Lisp is designing nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt; (video, 52 minutes).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An interview on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeveloperVoices"&gt;Developer Voices&lt;/a&gt; podcast with &lt;a href="https://www.schafmeistergroup.com/"&gt;Prof Christian
Schafmeister&lt;/a&gt; on designing enzymes using a custom dialect of Lisp
to control computational chemistry libraries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He initially started from an idea based on CAD applications
(written in Smalltalk), but rapidly realised there were too many
possible components and combinations to work with graphically and
so started treating it as a language-design problem – and
designed a custom Lisp based on &lt;a href="https://ecl.common-lisp.dev/"&gt;ECL&lt;/a&gt;. Lisp provides simplicity and
efficiency, as well as being a "forever" language in which
software keeps working over the long term.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge13fcda"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
John McCarthy.  &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/960118.808386"&gt;A Micro-Manual for Lisp: Not the Whole Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. ACM
SIGPLAN Notices &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;, pp.215–216. 1978.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A "manual" in the sense of providing a complete implementation of
Lisp – in Lisp itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is that useful? A semantics expert would say "no", since such a
model has no real explanatory power: the recursion doesn't
bottom-out to define the concepts. However, a programming language
expert might disagree and observe that this is &lt;i&gt;meta-linguistic
abstraction&lt;/i&gt;, the use of one high-level language to capture the
definition of another. The "host" language provides a higher level
of abstraction than is usual when writing interpreters and
compilers, so it becomes easier to experiment with different forms
of "target" language as there's less low-level work to do. This
benefit exists even when host and target are the same: essentially
the target is bootstrapped and can then be adjusted while running
within an earlier version of itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As far as I know this is the first example of meta-linguistic
abstraction in the computer science literature. The idea was
popularised by &lt;a href="/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/"&gt;SICP&lt;/a&gt; (using Scheme), and forms the basis for a lot
of modern bootstrapped compilers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

paper 79. MIT AI Laboratory. 1974.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A description of the architecture later built and sold by LMI.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A visionary description of a machine to run Lisp at a
"non-prohibitive cost" of $70,000 per system. (The web tells me
that this is the equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1974?amount=70000"&gt;$440,000&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.) A completely
integrated system based on a Cons processor and using a PDP-11 as
a console. A relocating, compacting, garbage collector with
invisible forwarding pointers. Non-linear spaghetti stacks to
support advanced programming constructs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the many notable facets of this design is one of its
proposals (the "frame pushdown list") to avoid excessive conses
and garbage collection overhead by maintaining lists of blocks of
particular sizes. It uses this approach to manage the creation of
call stack frames; modern Python implementations use this scheme
throughout to avoid heap fragmentation through allocating and
re-allocating blocks of different sizes. (Lisp has this feature
generally, of course, with its use of fixed-size cons cells.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's also fascinating to see that, even at this early stage,
hardware design was being seen as an exercise in refinement to
maintain software-level abstractions even as features were being
pushed into hardware – while still providing optimised
implementations that were invisible to the programmer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Adam Tornhill.  &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://leanpub.com/lispweb"&gt;Lisp for the Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Leanpub. 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A short, practical guide to build a dynamic web site entirely
using Common Lisp. Makes extensive use of several libraries,
including the intriguingly-named &lt;a href="https://edicl.github.io/hunchentoot/"&gt;hunchentoot&lt;/a&gt; web server (named
after a never-staged musical written by Frank Zappa), the &lt;a href="https://edicl.github.io/cl-who/"&gt;CL-WHO&lt;/a&gt;
HTML generator, and – perhaps most interesting – the &lt;a href="https://cliki.net/Parenscript"&gt;Parenscript&lt;/a&gt;
Lisp to Javascript compiler.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One gain from using Lisp is the ability to wrap-up standard
constructions like page templates as macros. Other than this, it's
hard to assess whether the gains are all that significant. One
interesting point is that the whole development occurs in Lisp, so
there's no cognitive dissonance between writing the back-end and
the front-end: essentially the same argument for using &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/"&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt; as
a back-end framework. While Parenscript isn't a fully-featured
Lisp-in-the-browser it again can benefit from macros and other
features. There's a throwaway comment about linking it to &lt;a href="https://jquery.com/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;,
although that isn't demonstrated in practice: it feels intriguing,
though, especially if there's a way to represent jQuery
functionality idiomatically in Lisp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The original Lisp paper from 1960, which opens:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A programming system called LISP (for LISt Processor) has been
developed for the IBM 704 computer…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The paper then proceeds to lay out everything that's since been
built on: the basic constructs, the use of cons cells (pairs) as a
data representation, the world's first garbage collection algorithm,
an equational semantics, and ideas for interpretation and
compilation. It's awesome, and humbling to read it and realise its
age and the vision of computing it developed.
&lt;/p&gt;

(Despite this paper being labelled Part I, incidentally, there
isn't a part II.)

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An absolute classic of both AI and Lisp, and really two books in
one. The applications presented cover the entire range of
"classic" AI up to the late 90s: expert systems, logic
programming, symbolic mathematics, knowledge representation,
constraint programming, game search, syntax-driven natural
language processing, and more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It uses Lisp as the programming vehicle, and doesn't shy-away from
depth, dealing with the effects of garbage collection (and how to
program effectively in its presence), the effects of different
representations, low-level optimisation and disassembly, and all
the approaches one needs to use Lisp in real, scalable practice.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An extensive list of recipes for using common data structures,
how the differ in Lisp from the equivalents in other languages,
and what novel features Lisp has to offer. A great place to start
when moving away from being a beginner, and for dipping into in
search of solutions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's probably strongest on the "gotchas" and dangers that Lisp
presents, but also has a lot to say about coding style and code
optimisation.

	George Seldes
	  (1935)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;"All of Mussolini's monuments will be monuments to the strength of a weakling."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A journalist's account of Mussolini's rise to (and exercise of) power, written by someone who both lived through parts of it and had significant contacts with the man himself. Despite being written at a time when Fascism was still being somewhat celebrated, and even admired, it's quite a scorching read that dismantles many of its pretensions with both observations and data. It would have provided a lot of ammunition to those wanting to avoid fascist takeovers in their ovn countries to read exactly how imaginary the claims of Fascist Italy were, no matter how dramatically and repeatedly proclaimed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprising for a book of its kind and date (it was first published in 1935), Hitler is conspicuous by his absence, mentioned only in passing: there are far more comparisons with Napoleon. It shows how different history looks when lived forwards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The title is interesting: Shirer uses a similar turn of phrase to describe Mussolini in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich_A_History_of_Nazi_Germany" title="The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich A History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; (although he does not reference Seldes as a source). Mussolini's will to power easily overrides any principles he may have had, which makes it hard to decide whether fascism itself had any principles or was simply the inflation of one man's will: Mussolini seems to have been unclear about that himself, but resolving it may be key to understanding the modern trends towards authoritarian politics.

	  (1981)

    &lt;p&gt;
      The lesser-known – now – precursor novel to cyberpunk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A group of rebels engage in pranks and more serious data exfiltration using hallucinatory interfaces to computer-managed information spaces. If that sounds similar to &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6088007.Neuromancer__Sprawl___1_" title="Neuromancer (Sprawl, #1) by William Gibson" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt; then that's because the parallels are unmistakeable. The two books appeared at roughly the same time, and initially &lt;i&gt;True names&lt;/i&gt; seems to have been the more famous: certainly it attracted a lot of attention from some serious people in both tech and sci-fi. It's interesting that &lt;i&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/i&gt; emerged over the longer term as the more significant work: and I think that's deserved, although &lt;i&gt;True names&lt;/i&gt; remains a great read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both books address the issue of information overload and how it could be combatted by using broader-band neural interfaces rather than screens and keyboards. Gibson envisions a rather architectural metaphor, while Vinge goes for something more mythic and fantastical, a world whose practitioners form "covens" and interact with spells and monsters as a way to bring the available functionality into their limited view. It's not something that's actually emerged in what we now think of as cyberspace, which remains resolutely text-driven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My edition of &lt;i&gt;True names&lt;/i&gt; came with essays and an afterward by Marvin Minsky, one of the fathers of AI. The essays in the main haven't aged well, but Minsky's critique of procedural computing still has some bite.

	Menno Schilthuizen
	  (2018)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A take on evolutionary biology that sees cities and human-created environments as a positive force on ecology, without in any way diminishing the effects of human-caused demage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's an interesting perspective. Ecologists and the popular press often only see the damage, not the opportunity, of human construction, and regard species being forced from their "natural" habitats as always bad. Schilthuizen argues quite persuasively that habitat destruction has been mitigated by habitat &lt;i&gt;construction&lt;/i&gt;, by creating urban landscapes in which (often other) species can thrive possibly more than they did before. This is especially true when we also consider "invasive" species transported from elsewhere, which find niches in their destination cities (often around their ports of entry). In some cases we find species that no longer have or inhabit a "natural" habitat at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And habitat destruction often isn't as complete as it seems. Schilthuizen example is the mice of New York's smaller parks, which form islands of isolation that in turn cause identifiable genetic differences between the inhabitants of the different tiny patches of land. Singapore similarly has tiny trats of native forest surrounded by city and cut-off from each other. He uses this carefully to argue that evolution requires neither great distinctions in environment nor wide reaches of time in which to operate in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a careful book that doesn't shy away from the difficult questions that evolution inevitably raises. Plenty of the cases discussed involve a complex mix of genetic evolution, epigenetic adaptation, individual learning, and group-based "culture" to change the animals' relationships with their environments. It's good to take on this complexity head-on, and that makes this stand out as a great introduction and illustration of the wider powers of natural selection.

	Stephan Malinowski
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Hohenzollerns are usually treated as bookmarks in histories of the two World Wars, with the Kaiser as an essential instigator of the First and laying the groundwork for the Second despite his defenestration. This book picks up his life in exile in the Netherlands as an increasingly anachronistic character unable to handle the need to explain himself even to his own most loyal followers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That loyalty and blindness extends to his descendants, who remain pretenders to leadership well into the Nazi period and attempt to ride the storm while simultaneously keeping a distance from it, unable to accept that they're no longer relevant or even respected except in the most superficial ways. It's as though they want to take credit for Nazi accomplishments and are untroubled by the atrocities as long as it offers the possibility of a return to the throne – and are similarly untroubled by the fact that that thronw would never actually be a real power centre. The Kaiser's emphasis on the forms over the functions of royalty have a long reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The translation is little grating at times, fascinated by the word &lt;i&gt;caesura&lt;/i&gt;. But the pace is good and it deals well with the contradictions and (still continuing) attempts to rewrite family history to remove the taint of association with Hitler – while (coincidentally I'm sure) restoring family property.

    &lt;p&gt;
      £5 well spent in a charity shop. This is a collection of essays on different historical mysteries. There's something for everyone: the building of Stonehenge, the abandonment of the &lt;i&gt;Mary Celeste&lt;/i&gt;, and (my personal favourite) the fate of the Princes in the Tower. Perhaps a book best dipped into.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the essays haven't aged well against subsequent scholarship. That's inevitable and doesn't detract from them as decent introductions to a wide range of happenings.

    &lt;p&gt;
      I was expecting a book that was more calculator focussed, perhaps misled by the sub-title. This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a book about pocket (and other) calculators, but it's more a book about &lt;i&gt;calculation&lt;/i&gt; and its mechanical assistants, from the abacus and Napier's Bones through to computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that having been said, it's a great history. It addresses the needs that have driven mechanical computation over the centuries, as the applications have changed alongside the technology (and in many ways have driven its development). You can see this in the way that the scale of the machines changes, becoming alternately smaller and more pocket-sized and then larger as the increasing demands require steam or electrical power. (The latter can be miniaturised while the former clearly can't.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we would actually regard as pocket calculators occupy only a tiny part of the story. I think there's a more detailed history that could still be written about the different processors used, methods of entry used (for example HP's determined and continued use of reverse-Polish notation), and how these were taken up by sub-groups within science, engineering, and finance and used almost as tribal signifiers ("&lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; engineers use HP"). But that would miss the wider story that this book tells well.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Surrealist science fiction at its best. A selection of short stories told from the perspective of a being simultaneously almost god-like and hopelessly confused as the universe evolves around him (it?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a hard work to classify. My closest analogy would be with &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18194.The_Cyberiad" title="The Cyberiad by Stanisław Lem" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Cyberiad&lt;/a&gt;, but with less narrative consistency and a far broader scope.

      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Are there lessons here? I'm not entirely sure. It's certainly a rags-to-riches story of a self-made man, and a very entertaining and honest one. Whether it provides any insights into the world of private equity is less clear to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hands made his money from corporate takeovers followed by ruthless cost-cutting and asset-stripping. This is good for him, possibly good for the next buyer – and utterly tragic for everyone else concerned, whose jobs are eliminated or consolidated with scarcely a backward glance, and the excuse that the companies would have failed anyway. That might be true, but it's not a certainty, and it can only happen in a culture where everything has been financialised without any broader responsibilities being taken (or even admitted to exist). Hands' later philanthrophy has to be set against this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It all rather crashes down when Hands buys a record company, perhaps the epitome of a company whose value comes predominantly from the people it employs and not (as had been the rationale for the deal) from the back catalogue of hits. It shows how &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; companies and industries can be, flying in the face of the simplifications of finance that they can all be treated the same. Maybe that's the lesson, albeit possibly an unintended one.

	Katrin Himmler
	  (2005)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The family history of Heinrich Himmler and his two brothers Gebhard and Ernst, as told by his great-niece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a lot of fascinating backstory in this book, and it explains a lot. It portrays Heinrich Himmler as very much the product of a middle-class, socially ambitious family who pushed him relentlessly to succeed and only seemed really to embrace him after he achiveed visible success as a Reichstag deputy and then later as Reichsführer-SS. The author, Katrin, has access to lots of family papers and photographs that have never been explored before, as well as being able to talk informally to Heinrich's brothers' children about their experiences. This makes this a profoundly personal exploration of Heinrich's rise and fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's also its weakness, of course, of which Katrin herself is well aware: it was cleaerly not an easy book to write, and one led her to realise how much families re-write their own histories – understandbaly so in the light of what happened. It also means the the book as a whole concentrates on the domestic side of Heinrich's life, which can be jarring: the period from him being a secretary to leading the SS is covered in less than a page. Overall, though, there's a lot of keen insight provided into the making of a monster.

	  (2023)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A timely and troubling consideration of social breakdown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most notable thing about this novel is that it happens in Ireland: not "far away", but in a European country that is nevertheless seen as collapsing through (it is hinted) a shift to the right taken by fully democrtic means, and a subsequent descent into authoritarianism. That's a perfectly believable scenario for many countries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lynch writes in a stream-of-consciousness style that manages to be comprehensible while still retaining the slightly bewildered feeling of someone caught-up in event they don't fully understand and can't quite keep up with. There's enough Irish vernacular and geographical detail to make the story hard-hitting for anyone who knows Dublin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people desperately cling to processes that no longer have any meaning; there are huge numbers of forms to fill out despite them serving no purpose; there's lots of bureaucracy used to drum people into compliance; and there's lots of venality hiding behind the continuation of these processes to convert them into vehicles for personal gain. Rules tighten as order breaks down, and the same cast of chancers and bandits and people-smugglers emerge in Ireland as in other countries that have gone through this kind of trauma. And that I think is the main message of the book. The themes and characters emerging from social breakdown are universal, and a European country would go the same way as anywhere else.

	Scott J. Shapiro
	  (2023)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A lawyer's take on hacking. That's both a compliment and a limitation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book presents itself as being a history of hacking. It kind of is, and covers some famous incidents in varying degrees of detail. It spends a lot of time making the underlying technology understandable to a non-technical reader, which is a major contribution. One could argue that it's mis-named, in that it spends more time on the hacking of Paris Hilton's cellphone and the evolution of the Mirai botnet than on Fancy Bear's attack on the US Democrats., but it does place these attacks into a wider and useful context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the wider context is als0 a problem. Shapiro is a legal philosopher – and it shows. Firstly he annoyingly introduces terminology to distinguish between computer code ("downcode") and social norms and the law ("upcode"), with "metacode" sitting in between. Is this distinction useful? – I don't think so, since the whole point about "upcode" is that it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; code but a set of political choices and norms. Secondly, he tries to draw a distinction between criminal use of computers and espionage, arguing that the former is illegal but that the latter is not – and from this tries to argue that US responses to state-directed hacking are hypocritical. Well, yes: is that a point worth making, and does it have any significance beyond the purely philosophical?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirdly, the book also has a somewhat rosy view of US behaviour which is (in my opinion) contradicted by the facts and by the arguments of other books – for example &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247043.This_Is_How_They_Tell_Me_the_World_Ends_The_Cyberweapons_Arms_Race" title="This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends The Cyberweapons Arms Race by Nicole Perlroth" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race&lt;/a&gt;, which deals with the origins of cyberweapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are also some annoying wild claims. Turing's results absolutely &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; say that finding bugs in code is undecidible; this &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; stop us from radically improving our technological approaches to malware; we &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; think that problems are decidable because they're all that we see; and a belief in the fundamental comprehensibility of the universe is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; absurd. These weaken the presentation and detract from its undounbted strong points.

      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A book using colour as a way to access a range of other topics, without ever losing focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the choices will probably be controversial, such as the emergence of "whiteness" as a racial classification, even though supported plentifully by evidence. There are plenty of other less challenging anecdotes, though. Why do we usually consider there that there are &lt;i&gt;seven&lt;/i&gt; colours? – at least in part because of Newton's religious and alchemical ideas that led him to want to tie colour to the notes on the musical scale&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I most enjoyed the chapter on purple, mainly because it focused on the significant technological change that synthetic aniline dyes brought into culture, changing the relative abundances of various colours and changing the ways in which they were perceived as signifiers of wealth and status.

	Tony Fadell
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Twenty-five years ago, more or less, I ran a start-up company. I wish books like this had existed back then to help me understand what start-ups need to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fadell has perhaps the best pedigree imaginable, including being involved both in massive successes (the iPod, the iPhone, the Nest thermostat) and crashing failures (General Magic), and the best thing about this book is his willingness to share them, warts and all. He's clearly come to a place in his life where he regards everything as a learning opportunity and a teaching opportunity, rather than needing to project a particular image of himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The business advice is fascinating, even for someone who doesn't intend to start a company: there's plenty to learn about organisation structures and politics. I suspect it'd be absolute gold for anyone thinking of making hardware devices for the modern software-dominated world, though. Fadell has a clear understanding of what's needed to make a physical product succeed, and his emphases on story-telling and understanding the customer's journey as a route to success are compelling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's also a lot of insight into some of the major companies and personalities he's met along the way. He's positive about Apple, clear-eyed about Steve Jobs' strengths and weaknesses – and clearly quite shell-shocked by his exposure to Google as not what he was expecting them to be.

      An alternative history that has aged well. The premise is quite common: what if Nazi Germany had invaded Britain in the Spring of 1941, and succeeded? The plot revolves around rescuing the King and retrieving atomic secrets, both to be sent to America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's the politics of a Nazi occupation that clearly most fascinated Deighton, because he build a labyrinth of plots and counter-plots between Army, SS, British Resistance, and American isolationism. These internecine struggles are actually quite familiar from the actual history of Nazi occupations, so it's quite fascinating to see them transplanted to a fictional Britain. It's so well done that it's a shame it isn't part of a series (of which Deighton wrote several).

	Neil Theise
	  (2023)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I'd heard a lot about this book, and expected a lot from it. Theise isn't the first writer get lost in quantum weirdness, and he won't be the last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first half is a tour of complexity science, focusing on where the boundaries of complex systems lie: the "quenched disorder" threshold between static order and complete disorder, and the existence of emergent phase changes in systems constructed from lots of simple interactions. Lovelock's "daisyworld" is a great example of this, and Theise is very strong on assigning credit where it is due (Lynn Margulis' contributions are often overlooked). It's an approach that could be taken a lot further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then it all goes wrong, lost in the mazes of quantum theory and its superficial compatibilities with various kinds of mysticism. But there are lots of different mystic systems, and choosing to focus on three that have been selected for their similarities with a naive interpretation of quantum mechanics tells us precisely nothing about reality: there are plenty of others that are entirely incompatible (including most mainstream religions), which suggests it's at least possible for mysticism and science to coincide by chance. And it's a category error to then try to reason &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt; from the mystic to the scientific in an attemot to "explain" complexity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This absolutely &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; what it claims to be – a scientific theory of consciousness and connectedness – because it commits the fundamental error of being selective with the data. Just because we can't (yet) explain quantum entanglement and decoherence doesn't mean that panpsychism has anything to tell us about reality. This sort of "reconciliation" of science ("western") and mysticism ("eastern") isn't new, isn't informative, and (to my mind) does both a disservice.

	Stephen Wolfram
	  (1997)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I have very mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand it's a triumph of computational experimental technique, taking an idea that was well-known (cellular automata) and subjecting it to rigorous exploration. This uncovers a lot of new science, not least showing that complex systems can arise from even the simplest set of rules, but also that this complexity falls into classes that show graded complexity depending purely on the fine structure of the initial conditions. That's a massively important discovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand.... It's hard to describe this as a "new kind" of science. "New science," yes, but not indicative of a new paradigm or &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; of doing science, other than by emphasising the structured use of simulation. Wolfram completely over-sells what he's achieved, making claims he can't substantiate to aggrandise his own contributions. And that's a shame, not least because it's so &lt;i&gt;unnecessary&lt;/i&gt;: Wolfram has made some important discoveries, both here and to several other branches of physics and computer science, as well as popularising computational methods and tools. It's tragic that he doesn't seem to be able to appreciate himself as being sufficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is also quite terribly written, being almost half-composed of footnotes, meaning a reader is constantly skipping forwards and back: difficult in print, and I suspect impossible in a digital edition unless it's been very carefully hyperlinked. And the footnotes are often important! – indeed, they often provide evidence to back-up a claim in the main text that's entirely unsupportable from what's been presented. So it can be seen as both excessively long and insufficiently detailed, which is quite an achievement.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Why is modern civilisation so self-destructive and complicated? The answer from this alternative history is that a previously time of happiness and long lives was subverted by a change in the universal forces to induce the current malaise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did enjoy this book, but it does live up to its sub-title: &lt;i&gt;Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days&lt;/i&gt;. It's told in a very disjointed form using purported reports and other documents, much of the time from the diary of a young girl who doesn't really know what's going on, and so can't really advance the plot very effectively. That makes it hard work, even though the writing and the overall premise are excellent.

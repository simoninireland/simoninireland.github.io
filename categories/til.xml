&lt;h2 id="org01cca7d"&gt;TIL: Web site carbon ratings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org01cca7d"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I learned about a site that rates web pages according to their
carbon footprints.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My web site does well:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://simondobson.org/attachments/16/f4bcd8-963e-40ce-9f63-be78ec585965/rating-simondobson-org.png" alt="nil"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not all that surprised by this, since I &lt;a href="/development/this-site/"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; a static site
generator and minimal (almost no) JavaScript: basically as low-power
as one could get.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/simondobson-org/"&gt;full report&lt;/a&gt; includes an approximate carbon cost per page visit
(60mg), and even tries to work out the underlying energy provision,
dirty or renewable – dirty in my case at the moment, unfortunately.
(I'm currently hosted on GitHub.) I should perhaps take the hint and
move onto an alternative provider, or even host it myself with a
solar-powered Raspberry Pi. &lt;a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/"&gt;Low-tech Magazine&lt;/a&gt; does this, but they
&lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; based in Barcelona rather than Scotland…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can even include a badge that reports your rating "live":
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="wcb" class="carbonbadge"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/website-carbon-badges@1.1.3/b.min.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(It caches so as to only make one request per day.) On the other
hand this increases the JavaScript footprint slightly, so I don't
think I'll be using it anywhere apart from just here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>til</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/2024/03/04/til-web-site-carbon-ratings/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 18:50:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>TIL: An RSS-focused search engine</title><link>https://simondobson.org/2024/01/26/til-an-rss-focused-search-engine/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;div id="outline-container-org78d0e89" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org78d0e89"&gt;TIL: An RSS-focused search engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org78d0e89"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I learned about &lt;a href="https://feedle.world/"&gt;feedle&lt;/a&gt;, a search engine focused on searching
blogs and podcasts – web sites that export an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, in other
words. And the search results are themselves RSS feed that can be
subscribed to live.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This feels like a quite a big thing for accessing content without
resort to the internet giants, and for the &lt;a href="https://indieweb.org/"&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; in general. It
means that search can prefer syndicated and typically small-scale
content rather than being influenced by search engine optimisation
(SEO) or sponsorship affecting the link rankings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course this also need management, and feedle is a curated source:
you have to submit your RSS feed to it for review and (hopefully)
inclusion. I've done that for &lt;a href="https://simon.dobson.org/rss.xml"&gt;this site's feed&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org800ca81"&gt;TIL: The first scientist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org800ca81"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I learned that &lt;a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/10/20/mary-somerville/"&gt;the first person ever to be called a
"scientist"&lt;/a&gt; was the Scottish … erm, scientist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville"&gt;Mary Sommerville&lt;/a&gt;
(1780–1872), who made discoveries across several fields of
mathematics, physics, and astronomy, and was one of the first two
women admitted to membership of the Royal Astronomical Society.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was the fact that she was both a woman and a polymath that led to
the need for a new word. She clearly wasn't a "man of science", as
was the common description; nor did she fall into the accepted
classes such as geologist or chemist, since she contributed to all
these fields and more. So &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whewell"&gt;William Whewell&lt;/a&gt;, the Master of Trinity
College, Cambridge, and the person who had introduced one of
Sommerville's books to the university's maths curriculum, decided to
unify all these specific classes into the new general category of
&lt;i&gt;scientist&lt;/i&gt;. (He also introduced the terms &lt;i&gt;physicist&lt;/i&gt; and
&lt;i&gt;linguistics&lt;/i&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>science</category><category>til</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/2024/01/10/til-the-first-scientist/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 14:57:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>TIL: The first ever .com domain</title><link>https://simondobson.org/2024/01/02/til-the-first-ever-com-domain/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;div id="outline-container-orgdc47e9e" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgdc47e9e"&gt;TIL: The first ever .com domain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdc47e9e"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I learned that the first .com internet domain registered on
the internet was &lt;a href="https://symbolics.com"&gt;https://symbolics.com&lt;/a&gt; and belonged to Symbolics, a
company that made Lisp machines.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It doesn't relate to Lisp any more, of course. It's been sold to
someone who "helps entrepreneurs and investors acquire high-end
domain names", which seems about as meta as things can get: the
first-ever .com domain name now points a company focused on
acquiring domain names.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Symbolics itself has a storied history, spinning-out from the MIT AI
lab to sell hardware dedicated to running Lisp: one of &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; such
start-ups actually. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Incidentally, the rest of the top-ten first .com domains can be
found &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/dec/22/internet-domains"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
Today I learned that regenerative braking in an electric car doesn't
work at all well in the cold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org24e9b62"&gt;TIL: Stroke order of Chinese surnames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org24e9b62"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes we publish papers with authors in alphabetical order;
sometimes we use an order based on contribution, typically the main
author (often the most junior) first followed by the lesser
contributors and culminating in the most senior author, who might not
have made many concrete contributions to the writing. Personally I'm
a firm believer in the second style.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But I always wondered: how does one list authors in alphabetical
order for languages like Chinese that are non-alphabetic? I had the
opportunity to ask a couple of Chinese colleagues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While Chinese doesn't have an &lt;i&gt;alphabetical&lt;/i&gt; order, it can use a
&lt;i&gt;stroke&lt;/i&gt; order: some surnames require more strokes than others,
often significantly more (four &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; eleven, in the case of the
two colleagues who explained this to me). So one can list authors in
order of the increasing numbers of strokes needed to write their
surnames.  That's really clever, and no more or less arbitrary in
terms of author appearance than the alphabetic approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>An abstract is an advertisement, not an introduction.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I've spent much of this week working with MSc students writing their dissertations, and this has inevitably led to the part of a dissertation that often causes the most pain to write (and read, for that matter): the abstract.</p>
<p>What is the abstract of a report or paper? What it <em>isn't</em> is an introduction or guide to the rest of the document: that, unsurprisingly, is what the introduction is for. The goal of an abstract is much simpler: it's intended to persuade the reader to read some or all of the rest of the document. It may be surprising that this is an issue, but in a world in the grip of an information explosion it's clear that readers' attention is a limiting quantity in information processing. As a reader, should you bother to read a paper? Or not? And how do you make this decision?</p>
<p>Many new researchers, when confronted with a paper, start at the front and work forward. More experienced researchers know this is a mistake that leads to reading whole tracts of irrelevance or nonsense. (The former is worse: nonsense at least has occasional entertainment value.) This leads many people (myself included) to adopt a non-linear reading style:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the abstract</li>
    <li>If still interested, read the conclusion</li>
    <li>If <em>still</em> interested, read the introduction</li>
    <li>If it's <em>really</em> interesting, read the rest of the paper</li>
</ol>
(There are several variants, a couple of which are described <a href="http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/top_science-fair_how_to_read_a_scientific_paper.shtml" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Read-a-Scientific-Paper" target="_blank">here</a>.) The point here is that we can filter out papers of lesser interest to reserve time and head space for the most interesting. Only if the results grab your attention do you need to spend time discovering the detail of how they were obtained -- rather than doing that work only discover that you don't care about the results being reported.
<p>The abstract is the key: without a decent description of what the paper is about, the discerning reader will not proceed even to the introduction, and therefore any work contained in the paper will remain unread -- and therefore be largely worthless.</p>
<p>So how does one write a decent abstract? Most experienced scientists have their own technique, and the approach does need to vary from field to field and for different paper styles: a review paper is different to a piece of primary research. The approach I've come to rely on for research in computer science and mathematics can be described succinctly as <strong>the five-sentence abstract</strong>. I've found five sentences seems to be about optimal, structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="color: red">The area of the paper (1 sentence).</span> The problem area to which this paper makes a contribution.</li>
    <li>
<span style="color: orange">The issue the paper addresses (1 sentence).</span> Presumably the area is not yet fully explored, and you've found a problem that needs tackling -- otherwise what's in your paper?</li>
    <li>
<span style="color: green">What you've done, the results you've obtained (2 sentences).</span> The key contribution of the paper, what you've added to practice and/or knowledge</li>
    <li>
<span style="color: blue">What this means (1 sentence).</span> Why should anyone care?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's do an example, from a paper I've always wanted to write about finding unicorns:</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: red">There are lots of interesting animals out there, many of which have horns.</span> <span style="color: orange">No-one has yet reported observing any one-horned horses, however.</span> <span style="color: green">We describe our research survey of the horses of the West of Ireland. While we found many horses, and many other horned animals, we failed to locate any horned horses.</span> <span style="color: blue">We conclude that further research is required to find unicorns, preferably in an equally pleasant holiday destination.</span>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, perhaps not a great example. Let's try another, from a real paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: red">In the domain of ubiquitous computing, the ability to identify the occurrence of situations is a core function of being context-aware.</span> <span style="color: orange">Given the uncertain nature of sensor information and inference rules, reasoning techniques that cater for uncertainty hold promise for enhancing the reasoning process.</span> <span style="color: green">In our work, we apply the Dempster Shafer theory of evidence to infer situation occurrence with the minimal use of training data. We describe a set of evidential operations for sensor mass functions using context quality and evidence accumulation for continuous situation detection.</span> <span style="color: blue">We demonstrate how our approach enables situation inference with uncertain information using a case study based on a published smart home data set.</span>
</blockquote>
<p>(Taken from McKeever, Ye, Coyle and Dobson. <a href="http://www.simondobson.org/softcopy/ds-situation-inference-eurossc-09.pdf">Using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence for situation inference</a>. In Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Smart Sensing and Context (EuroSSC). Volume 5741 of LNCS. Springer-Verlag. Guildford, UK. 2009.) The abstract goes from domain to challenge to approach to significance: having read it, the reader hopefully has a fairly good idea of what the paper contributes to which domain, and why this contribution is significant (in the authors' minds, at least).</p>
<p>Shorter is often better, of course:</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: red">Wireless sensor networks are attracting increasing interest</span> <span style="color: orange">but suffer from severe challenges such as power constraints and low data reliability. Sensors are often energy-hungry and cannot operate over the long term, and the data they gather are frequently erroneous in complex ways. The two problems are linked, but existing work typically treats them independently:</span> <span style="color: green">in this paper we consider both side-by-side,</span> <span style="color: blue">and propose a self-organising solution for model-based data collection that reduces errors and communications in a unified fashion.</span>
</blockquote>

In Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Self-Organising Systems (IWSOS'13). Palma de Mallorca, ES. May 2013.) In this case my student Lei messed with the sentence structure because we wanted to get across the idea that the main problem was the totality of the existing approach to the problem, which we wanted to address as a whole. The abstract still follows the basic structure, and I think is stronger for being shorter.</p>
<p>No rule of writing is hard-and-fast, of course, and so you'll often find great abstracts that adopt a completely different approach. I don't think this matters so much as ensuring that the abstract is fit for purpose: an enticement to read further.</p>

<p>A discussion on the different styles of PhD thesis that might be appropriate for different students and research areas.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I was talking to one of my students about the "shape" of their PhD, and how we might present the work they're doing in the final thesis. This particular student is working on the science of complex coupled networks, which is a very new area of network science -- itself a pretty new field. The exact details of her work aren't important: the important point is that it's an area that's so poorly understood that it's hard to ask meaningful detailed questions about it.</p>
<p>A PhD is a training in research: the work done in the course of one doesn't usually change the world, and a fact that's often forgotten is that <em>they're not supposed to</em>. The goal of a PhD is to demonstrate that the candidate can conceive of, plan, conduct, evaluate a communicate a programme of research, sustained over typically three or four years, that adds something to human knowledge. Clearly there are many ways one can demonstrate this, and the question we were asking was: what are the variations? How do we choose which is appropriate?</p>
<p>A typical thesis is a monograph, written specially to describe the research, its process and results. In this it's very different from a scientific paper, which typically focuses on a single result and often elides a lot of the motivation and process. Publications along the way always help, of course: they let a reader (or examiner) know that the work being presented has been reviewed by others in the field, which always gives a certain amount of confidence that it contains worthwhile results. (Few things make a PhD examiner's heart sink more than a thesis with no associated publications. It means you're on your own in terms of assessing every aspect of the work.) The monograph needs a "shape", a skeleton upon which to hang the research, as well as clearly-enumerated contributions to knowledge and an understanding of its own boundaries.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of different styles of skeletal structure.</p>
<p><strong>The hypothesis.</strong> This is my favourite, truth be told. The work is encapsulated in a question, and the rest of the thesis seeks to answer this question. The answer might be yes, no, or maybe, all of which can be valid and can result in the award of a degree. The research then proves the hypothesis, disproves it, narrows it down as incomplete, or uncovers extra structure that would require substantially more work to explore -- or some combination of these.</p>
<p>There are several reasons to like this style of thesis. Firstly, the hypothesis is usually something concrete within the field of study. (It may seem hopelessly abstract to anyone outside the field, of course.) That makes it easy for an examiner or other reader to relate to: the question makes sense to them, as something one would want to know the answer to. Secondly -- and more importantly -- you have a pretty clear goal and consequently a pretty good notion of when you're finished. A PhD can almost always go on for ever, of course, but having a tight hypothesis means that you have a reference against which to test the work and decide whether it's sufficient to convince the reader of your conclusions.</p>
<p>Against this we may contrast the second type of thesis:</p>
<p><strong>Adventures in your chosen field.</strong> In this kind of thesis, there is no hypothesis. Instead, the thesis marks-out an area of interest and explores it, with a view to understanding or characterising some or all of it but without any driving question that demands an answer. Unlike the hypothesis, this kind of thesis isn't really "for" anything: it's intended as an exploration, a search for features -- and indeed possibly for hypotheses to be tested in the future. But this style of thesis is perfect for some areas, like mathematics and the more abstract end of computer science, where something new needs to be explored for a while to see if it makes sense and what is has to offer. (It's also found in non-monographical theses, where some universities allow candidates to submit a portfolio of published papers in place of the traditional approach. I must say I always find theses like these quite disjointed and fundamentally dissatisfying: there's a lot to be said for a purpose-written, rounded monograph as a conclusion to a programme of research.)</p>
<p>One would probably have to admit that an "adventures" thesis is a little more challenging to examine, since it doesn't motivate its own intention as clearly as a "hypothetical" thesis. It's going to be harder for the candidate to decide when it's ready, too, since one can always do <em>just one more</em> search to find something else of interest. In that sense, an "adventurer" needs to be more disciplined both in deciding when enough is enough and in deciding what, of the many possible choices, constitute the interesting pathways to explore.</p>
<p>I don't think either style is inherently preferable. It depends entirely on the subject matter, and one could easily fall into the mistake of trying to construct a hypothesis for work that was really an "adventure", or indeed not constructing one for a thesis that really needed one to motivate and structure it. There's a clear difference between an exploratory thesis and a rambling one: the exploration needs structure and coherence.</p>
<p>It's also perhaps worth considering the psychologies and research styles of different students. Some students need concrete goals: to build something, to test something, to prove or disprove a conjecture. These people clearly benefit from doing "hypothetical" theses. Other students have an interest in an area rather than in any specific outcome, and so might prefer an "adventure". There's no point in forcing one into the other, any more than one can get a theoretically-inclined student motivated by coding (and the associated debugging): it's just not what floats their boat, and it's better that they know their own minds, strengths and interests than to spend three or four years engaged in a quest to which they're fundamentally misaligned.</p>

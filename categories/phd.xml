&lt;strong&gt;Funded PhD studentship&lt;/strong&gt;

The Schools of Computer Science and Medicine are looking to recruit a talented student to work on improving clinical trials of tuberculosis and other conditions using computational techniques.

TB and related conditions are extremely costly in human and financial terms, and trials of new drugs and therapies are complicated by difficult environmental conditions and other factors. Improvements to the trials process will potentially translate directly into improved interventions, and so will help save lives.

We seek to apply data-driven techniques to the design, analysis, and management of such trials. These techniques might include complex networks, computational epidemiology, machine learning, Bayesian analysis, and other cutting-edge approaches to data analytics. The ideal candidate will have an interest in data science applied to medical and biological problems, and an enthusiasm for working as part of a challenging multi-disciplinary project within St Andrews' new &lt;a href="http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk" target="_blank"&gt;Institute for Data-Intensive Research (IDIR)&lt;/a&gt;.

The studentship will be held jointly between the two Schools, with supervisors from Computer Science (Prof Simon Dobson, &lt;a href="https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/tom-kelsey%28289c44af-c861-4f85-a604-6be4e43855f1%29.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr Tom Kelsey&lt;/a&gt;) and Medicine (&lt;a href="https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/da/persons/stephen-henry-gillespie%28ce4435fa-8cee-4e25-92fe-30f18dfec159%29.html" target="_blank"&gt;Prof Stephen Gillespie&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Ruth Bowness).  We offer a stimulating and supportive environment within a small and intimate university in a beautiful setting.

The scholarship is fully funded to cover tuition fees and stipend for a registration period normally expected to be three-and-a-half years.

Informal inquiries can be made in the first instance to &lt;a href="mailto:simon.dobson@st-andrews.ac.uk"&gt;Prof Simon Dobson&lt;/a&gt;.

I'd welcome applicants interested in sensor networks, complex systems, and data science.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

We welcome students from a wide range of countries, our only major requirements being that you're excited by the idea of research and are able to conduct a complex programme within a small, friendly, and supportive environment.

In my case, I'm interested in hearing from potential students with interests in the following areas:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sensor networks, especially deploying sensors into the environment;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Complex system modelling, trying to model phenomena that operate on a range of scales; and&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Data science, particularly for how we collect, categorise, and work with large scientific datasets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

appropriate for different students and research areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to one of my students about the "shape" of their PhD,
and how we might present the work they're doing in the final thesis.
This particular student is working on the science of complex coupled
networks, which is a very new area of network science -- itself a
pretty new field. The exact details of her work aren't important: the
important point is that it's an area that's so poorly understood that
it's hard to ask meaningful detailed questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PhD is a training in research: the work done in the course of one
doesn't usually change the world, and a fact that's often forgotten is
that &lt;em&gt;they're not supposed to&lt;/em&gt;. The goal of a PhD is to
demonstrate that the candidate can conceive of, plan, conduct,
evaluate a communicate a programme of research, sustained over
typically three or four years, that adds something to human knowledge.
Clearly there are many ways one can demonstrate this, and the question
we were asking was: what are the variations? How do we choose which is
appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical thesis is a monograph, written specially to describe the
research, its process and results. In this it's very different from a
scientific paper, which typically focuses on a single result and often
elides a lot of the motivation and process. Publications along the way
always help, of course: they let a reader (or examiner) know that the
work being presented has been reviewed by others in the field, which
always gives a certain amount of confidence that it contains
worthwhile results. (Few things make a PhD examiner's heart sink more
than a thesis with no associated publications. It means you're on your
own in terms of assessing every aspect of the work.) The monograph
needs a "shape", a skeleton upon which to hang the research, as well
as clearly-enumerated contributions to knowledge and an understanding
of its own boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are however a couple of different styles of skeletal structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hypothesis.&lt;/strong&gt; This is my favourite, truth be told.
The work is encapsulated in a question, and the rest of the thesis
seeks to answer this question. The answer might be yes, no, or maybe,
all of which can be valid and can result in the award of a degree. The
research then proves the hypothesis, disproves it, narrows it down as
incomplete, or uncovers extra structure that would require
substantially more work to explore -- or some combination of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons to like this style of thesis. Firstly, the
hypothesis is usually something concrete within the field of study.
(It may seem hopelessly abstract to anyone outside the field, of
course.) That makes it easy for an examiner or other reader to relate
to: the question makes sense to them, as something one would want to
know the answer to. Secondly -- and more importantly -- you have a
pretty clear goal and consequently a pretty good notion of when you're
finished. A PhD can almost always go on for ever, of course, but
having a tight hypothesis means that you have a reference against
which to test the work and decide whether it's sufficient to convince
the reader of your conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this we may contrast the second type of thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventures in your chosen field.&lt;/strong&gt; In this kind of
thesis, there is no hypothesis. Instead, the thesis marks-out an area
of interest and explores it, with a view to understanding or
characterising some or all of it but without any driving question that
demands an answer. Unlike the hypothesis, this kind of thesis isn't
really "for" anything: it's intended as an exploration, a search for
features -- and indeed possibly for hypotheses to be tested in the
future. But this style of thesis is perfect for some areas, like
mathematics and the more abstract end of computer science, where
something new needs to be explored for a while to see if it makes
sense and what is has to offer. (It's also found in non-monographical
theses, where some universities allow candidates to submit a portfolio
of published papers in place of the traditional approach. I must say I
always find theses like these quite disjointed and fundamentally
dissatisfying: there's a lot to be said for a purpose-written, rounded
monograph as a conclusion to a programme of research.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would probably have to admit that an "adventures" thesis is a
little more challenging to examine, since it doesn't motivate its own
intention as clearly as a "hypothetical" thesis. It's going to be
harder for the candidate to decide when it's ready, too, since one can
always do &lt;em&gt;just one more&lt;/em&gt; search to find something else of
interest. In that sense, an "adventurer" needs to be more disciplined
both in deciding when enough is enough and in deciding what, of the
many possible choices, constitute the interesting pathways to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think either style is inherently preferable. It depends
entirely on the subject matter, and one could easily fall into the
mistake of trying to construct a hypothesis for work that was really
an "adventure", or indeed not constructing one for a thesis that
really needed one to motivate and structure it. There's a clear
difference between an exploratory thesis and a rambling one: the
exploration needs structure and coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also perhaps worth considering the psychologies and research
styles of different students. Some students need concrete goals: to
build something, to test something, to prove or disprove a conjecture.
These people clearly benefit from doing "hypothetical" theses. Other
students have an interest in an area rather than in any specific
outcome, and so might prefer an "adventure". There's no point in
forcing one into the other, any more than one can get a
theoretically-inclined student motivated by coding (and the associated
debugging): it's just not what floats their boat, and it's better that
they know their own minds, strengths and interests than to spend three
or four years engaged in a quest to which they're fundamentally
misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>phd</category><category>writing</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/2013/01/19/hypothetical-adventures-chosen-field/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2013 13:01:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PhD position available in intrusion detection</title><link>https://simondobson.org/2011/06/06/phd/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A colleague of mine has a fully-funded PhD studentship available in web security and intrusion detection.

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PhD Studentship in Immuno-inspired Web Intrusion Detection&lt;/h2&gt;
We invite applicants for a 3 year funded PhD position at the Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Strathclyde.

The increase in the number of reported cyber-attacks and the sophistication of their techniques is driving developments in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that are able to detect them in order to take action against them. Despite significant success in the detection of previously known attacks (misuse detection) our ability to reliably detect novel attacks remains limited.

In this context, it has long been observed that the role of IDS in computer systems is analogous to the role of the Human Immune System (HIS), and models of HIS operation have inspired IDS techniques. Taking inspiration from the HIS Danger Theory model (DT), we have proposed distress detection as a symptom-based approach to IDS.
A key challenge for investigations in this area is the lack of appropriate experimental testbeds and datasets. Existing datasets do not include the symptoms of cyber-attacks, while testbeds are limited in their ability to capture those symptoms. In order to address this challenge the aim of this project is to develop an experimental testbed for the exploration of symptom-based Web IDS.

The studentship will start in October 2011 and covers University Home fees plus a student stipend for 3 years (c. £13,590 for 2011/12).

The work will be co-supervised by Dr Sotirios Terzis and Dr Marc Roper.

All applicants must possess or be about to obtain a 1st class or 2.1 Honours degree or equivalent in a relevant discipline.

The type of candidate sought will have strong technical computer science/technical skills, ideally some experience web system administration and low-level systems programming, an enthusiasm for research coupled with a dogged persistence, a broad outlook and the ability to explore new ideas in depth, an ability to rapidly absorb new technical innovations.

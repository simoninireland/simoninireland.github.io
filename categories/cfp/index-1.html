<p>The <a href="http://www.sapere-project.eu/" target="_blank">Sapere project</a> (of which I'm a member) is running a workshop at <a href="http://saso2012.univ-lyon1.fr/index.php" target="_blank">SASO 2012 in Lyons</a> on new ways to design service ecosystems.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Emerging distributed computing scenarios (mobile, pervasive, and social) are characterised by intrinsic openness, decentralisation, and dynamics. According, the effective deployment and execution of distributed services and applications calls for open service  frameworks promoting situated and self-adaptive behaviours, and supporting diversity in services and long-term evolvability. This suggests adopting nature-inspired and/or socially-inspired approaches, in which services are modelled and deployed as autonomous individuals in an ecosystem of other services, data sources, and pervasive devices. Accordingly, the self-organizing interactions patterns among components and the resulting emerging dynamics of the system, as those of natural systems or of social systems, can inherently exhibit effective properties of self-adaptivity and evolvability.</p>
<p>Although many initiatives (like those named upon digital/business service ecosystems) recognise that the complexity of modern service systems is comparable to that of natural ecosystems, the idea that nature – other than a mean to metaphorically characterise their complexity – can become the source of inspiration for their actual modelling and implementation is only starting being metabolised.</p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners, with the aims of unfolding the many challenges related to the modelling, design and implementation of adaptive service ecosystems in natural and social terms, and identifying promising approaches and solutions.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Software architectures for  emergent distributed systems.</li>
    <li>Bio-inspired self-organising patterns design patterns.</li>
    <li>Coordination models and languages.</li>
    <li>Middleware platforms</li>
    <li>Dynamic services composition.</li>
    <li>Adaptive coordination models and patterns</li>
    <li>Self-organisation and coordination</li>
    <li>Coordination in systems of feedback loops</li>
    <li>Middleware for adaptive coordination</li>
    <li>Multiagent systems</li>
    <li>Methodologies for adaptive and self-organising system engineering</li>
</ul>
All accepted papers will be published by IEEE Xplore following the workshop.
<p>Submission deadline is 4 July 2012. For more details please see the <a href="http://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/ASENSIS/" target="_blank">workshop web site</a>.</p>

<h2>Sixth International Workshop on Middleware Tools, Services and  Run-time Support for Networked Embedded Systems (<a href="http://www.midsens.org/index.html" target="_blank">MidSens’11</a>)</h2>
<h3>Co-located with <a href="http://2011.middleware-conference.org/">Middleware 2011</a> (December 12th - December 16th, 2011), Lisbon, Portugal</h3>
<p>The aim of MidSens’11 is to stimulate research in the  specific domain of middleware for networked embedded systems. This  year’s focus is on sensor networks and robotics control – a broader  focus than the previous editions – since we believe that the extended  scope will result in complementary and synergetic submissions from  researchers working in both niches. Along with the ‘core’ topic of  middleware architectures, services and tool support, MidSens’11 will  also seek quality papers describing novel programming languages,  run-time support and relevant experience reports. As with previous  editions of this workshop, MidSens’11 will investigate how middleware  support can relieve developers from low-level, platform specific  concerns, while enabling optimal exploitation of available resources. We  hope that you will be able to join us in Lisbon on December 12th 2011.</p>
<p>Middleware for networked embedded systems such as sensor networks and  robotics is a critical research domain which addresses key challenges  that application developers are facing today. The five previous editions  of this workshop (<a href="http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/conference/MidSens2006/">MidSens'06</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/conference/MidSens2007/">MidSens'07</a>, <a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/midsens08/">MidSens'08</a>, <a href="http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/events/midsens09/">MidSens'09</a> and <a href="http://www.midsens.org/2010/"> MidSens'10</a>)  attracted researchers from Europe, Asia, and the United States. The  MidSens workshop series has served to trigger and guide research efforts  to create an <em>integrated middleware vision</em>, which is required to  handle the challenges inherent in developing, deploying and managing  complex networked embedded applications in an efficient way.</p>
<p>The workshop seeks papers in, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Middleware Tools and Architectures:
<ul>
<li> Architectures for networked embedded systems.</li>
    <li> Novel programming abstractions.</li>
    <li> Lightweight agent middleware for embedded systems.</li>
    <li> Testing and simulation tools.</li>

This workshop is interested in data-intensive, distributed, and dynamic (D3) science. It will also focus on innovative approaches for scalability in the end-to-end real-time processing of scientific data. We refer to D3 applications as those are data-intensive, are fundamentally, or need to be, distributed, and need to support and respond to data that may be non-persistent and is dynamically generated. We are also looking to bring researchers together to look at holistic, rather than piecewise, approaches to the end-to-end processing and managing of scientific data.

There has been a lot of effort in managing and distributing tasks where computation is dominant. Such applications have after all, been historically the drivers of "grid" computing. There has been, however, relatively less effort on tasks where the computationalload is matched by the data load, or even dominated by the data load. For such tasks to be able to operate at scale, there are conceptually simple run-time tradeoffs that need to be made, such as determining whether to move data to compute versus moving compute to data, or possibly regenerating data on-the-fly. Due to fluctuating resource availability and capabilities, as well as insufficient prior information about application requirements, such decisions must be made at run-time. Furthermore, resource, connectivity and/or storage constraints may require the data to be manipulated in-transit so that it is "made-right" for the consumer. Currently it is very difficult to implement these dynamic decisions or the underlying mechanisms in a general-purpose and scalable fashion. Although the increasing volumes and complexity of data will make many problems data-dominated, the computational requirements will still be high. In practice, data-intensive applications will encompass data-driven applications. For example, many data-driven applications will involve computational activities triggered as a consequence of independently created data; thus it is imperative for an application to be able to respond to unplanned changes in data load or content. Therefore, understanding how to support dynamic computations is a fundamental, but currently missing element in data-intensive computing.

The D3Science workshop builds upon a 3 year research theme on Distributed Programming Abstractions (DPA, <a href="http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/Distributed_Programming_Abstractions">http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/Distributed_Programming_Abstractions</a>), which has held a series of related workshops including but not limited to e-Science 2008, EuroPar 2008 and the CLADE series, and the ongoing 3DPAS (<a href="http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/3DPAS">http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/3DPAS</a>) research theme funded by the NSF and UK EPSRC, which is holding one workshop in June 2011: the 3DAPAS workshop (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/3dapas/">https://sites.google.com/site/3dapas/</a>). The workshop is intended to lead to a funding proposal for transcontinental collaboration, with contributors as potential members of the collaboration, and as such, we are particularly interested is discussing both existing and future projects that are suitable for transcontinental collaboration.

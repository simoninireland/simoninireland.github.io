	  <h2>Atul Gawande</h2>
	    2014
	  <p>
	    </p>
<hr>
</div>
      </div>
      <p>
	An exploration of end-of-life care – something that's of interest to us all, of course, but very seldom addressed properly. And that's Gawande's essential point: people leave decisions about their last days <i>until</i> their last days, and so have a far worse time of it than perhaps they need to.<br><br>There's much more to this book that this, though. Gawande explores the different approaches to assisted living and hospice care, the ways in which focusing on social rather than medical aspects can lead to far better outcomes, and shares his own family's experiences with the difficulties that gradual illness can bring. (This is perhaps the greatest contribution of the book, and shows an enormous openness of spirit to share something so personal.) He demolishes the utopian visions of multi-generational living that sometimes cloud the debate, showing that this brings its own tensions: different to those of our more individualistic society, but certainly no less divisive. If nothing else, he shows that there <i>is</i> an alternative to medicalising old age, and that this is something we should all work towards in our own self-interest.

	  <h2>Rebecca Skloot</h2>
	    2010
	  <p>
	    </p>
<hr>
</div>
      </div>
      <p>
	Part scientific history, part social history, this is as much a book about modern American social exclusion as it is about one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of all time.<br><br>The science is nowhere near as well-known as it should be. The cancerous cells of a dying African-American woman became "HeLa", the first "immortal" cell line, and at a stroke revolutionise the study of diseases. Using just one of Skloot's several examples, HeLa allowed proper rigorous comparisons of different treatment regimes for the polio vaccine. Since then, HeLa has been at the centre of almost every major medical trial and breakthrough, and is still a critical component of education and research fifty years later.<br><br>HeLa was given away for free to researchers in an act of enormous generosity – and also, it has to be said, because it happened in an era before the major profit motive invaded medicine. But that is of no comfort to the descendants of Henrietta Lacks, the cells' original "donor". Not only are there serious questions of consent and the ethics of openly sharing material that can be used to identify and profile the likely medical histories of her descendants; they remain so poor that they live in situations almost unrecognisable as the 20th century Western world, dependent on charity because of lack of health insurance. Indeed, Skloot's descriptions of "Lackstown", where everyone is related and sharing a common lack of basic services, healthcare, or employment, is the most riveting part of the book. In many ways it evokes some of the Victorian reportage – <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25277164.People_of_the_Abyss__The" title="People of the Abyss, The by Jack London" rel="nofollow noopener">People of the Abyss, The</a>, for example – but without any ambition to bring about similar social change. The Lacks' conditions are described, deplored, and in some sense accepted in a way that's quietly troubling.<br><br>The last section of the book is also fascinating, reviewing the continuing history of consent as applied to tissue samples where rights of privacy and ownership collide with research goals and the public good. Skloot does a good job in showing how inherently complicated these issues are, and doesn't fall into the trap of taking simple sides.

<hr>
</div>
      </div>
      <p>
	Definitely a book that's passed through political correctness and come out the other side.<br><br>There seem to be a couple of issues drawing Rod Liddle's ire. The first is the narcissism of modern society, which he skewers mercilessly. The second is the emergence of a super-class of highly advantaged upper-middle-class families who are radically better able to access society's goods than others. Their advantages come from multiple sources – public schooling, living in better areas, social networks that can help access, and so forth – but also (Liddle claims) from a more surprising source: changes to the law that seem egalitarian but work to reinforce privilege.<br><br>Is super-class privilege now so entrenched as to be immovable? If you're looking for answers to this, or even some vague suggestions, you won't find them. But as a source of dinner-party factoids and telling phrases, this is a winner. People "who have had their struggles too" will definitely be part of my vocabulary from now on.

	  <h2>Charles Emmerson</h2>
	    2013
	  <p>
	    </p>
<hr>
</div>
      </div>
      <p>
	A rounded tour of the horizons of the year before the Great War.<br><br>Emmerson structures his history around the great cities of the world: London, New York, Paris, St Petersburg, and Berlin, all obviously, but also Mexico City, Durban. Winnipeg, Melbourne, Detroit, and others. He uses them as nuclei around which to describe the core events and factors driving the populations. That they are universally unaware of the catastrophe that is bearing down on them only reinforces the strange nature of the Great War, that its origins seem to defy credible explanation.<br><br>It's impossible to read this book without being reminded of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192955.The_Proud_Tower_A_Portrait_of_the_World_Before_the_War__1890_1914" title="The Proud Tower A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914 by Barbara W. Tuchman" rel="nofollow noopener">The Proud Tower : A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914</a>, Barbara Tuchman's portrait of Europe in the same period. And if Emmerson lack something of Tuchman's elegance, it's only a matter of degree: he has the same eye for anecdote, the same beautiful turns of phrase. He also favours wider-ranging sociology over Tuchman's considerations of art and politics. IN many ways to two books make useful companion pieces.<br><br>The overriding impression for a modern reader is the almost universal acceptance of racist and sexist foundations for societies, extending both to the rulers and to the ruled. Gandhi fights for the rights of Indians in South Africa without concerning himself about the rights of Africans; Irish Nationalists struggle for independence but deplore votes for women. The ability to rationalise clearly hasn't changed over the years.<br><br><br><br></p>

	  <h2>Morrissey</h2>
	    2013

<hr>
</div>
      </div>
      <p>
	Not a charming man.<br><br>I'm a Smiths fan, which at some level makes me a Morrissey fan <i>ipso facto</i>. And some of the poetic writing in this book is sublime, full of insight and inspiration. But the person looking out of the pages is the most ungracious, self-indulgent version of himself it's possible to imagine. From the mean streets of Manchester, through the roller-coaster ride of the Smiths, and then to court and a solo career, few people emerge unscathed, thanked, or even broadly acknowledged as helpers or influences.<br><br>I grew up not far away from Morrissey, in space and time, and I recognise a lot of his criticisms of Northern England in the 70's and 80's: he and I actually met once on the streets of Gorton in the mid 80's. But there's something compellingly surreal about his self-image as a tortured and mis-understood artist whose project is repeatedly sabotaged. None of the Smiths' records seem to be mixed to his tastes, although he was there and exercised at least a measure of control; no interviews went well, although they were more co-ordinated than spontaneous. He seems to see his solo career as a zenith, although I suspect most of his fans are waiting more or less impatiently for Smiths riffs and flashes of past insights. And I think he may know that at some level: there are lines from Smiths lyrics thrown in at strategic points of the story, as jewels for those in the know.

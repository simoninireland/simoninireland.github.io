      How dinosaurs drove the development of the theory of evolution – and a lot more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard to credit that the first dinosaurs were only discovered at the end of the 18th century. They emerged into a world that had little doubt about the literal truth of biblical creation. They helped to shatter that certainty, although not alone and not at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book that itself shatters several myths. It shows how Victorian scientists were as religious as their fellow citizens – and often more so – and how their faith coloured their interpretations of the evidence they themselves were discovering. It describes a Darwin too afraid of the possible social consequences ot publish his theories of natural selection as they are formed, and indeed he doesn't publish them until he's slowly built up his reputation as a naturalist through more traditional means: a level of patience that would be unthinkable today. And it shows that his interactions with Alfred Russel Wallace – often described as his rival – were marked by kindness and high regard on both sides, with Wallace modestly content in taking a supporting role (and later being a pallbearer at Darwin's interrment in Westminster Abbey).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the source of the 19th century the religious certainties are challenged successfully, but there was nothing inevitable about the triumph and the opponents absolutely did not go quietly. Atheism remained the last taboo: long after Catholics and non-confirmist Protestants had their civil and political rights restored, atheists still had to fight to be allowed to take seats in Parliament. Taylor presents this as part of the conflict driven by the dinosaurs and the scientific changes their discovery drove, and it's hard to argue with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some fascinating vignettes. My favourite is when Alfred Russel Wallace takes a bet to show the earth is not flat, and devises an ingenious method that of course doesn't rely on any modern technology or arguments, but which is self-evidently correct. That there are still many flat-earthers even today is testament to the abiding need to keep pressing for science and evidence in public life.

    &lt;p&gt;
      An amusing and informative study of corpses. Not a sentence I ever expected to write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book that digs into both the biology and the sociology of how we treat the dead. This includes the various uses made of cadavers over the year, from modern medical education to potions and "cures" made from mummies. Along the way we also get a discussion of different funeral practices being proposed by generations of free-thinkers and how they do (and don't) get adopted by wider society. In many ways it's amazing the the taboo against dissection and associated practices was &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; overcome: it seems to be an almost universal belief that the dead should be disposed of whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the content is fascinating, the writing style grates on me. I understand the need for some levity in dealing with a topic that has the potential to be offensive or distressing in equal means – but I wish Roach could have resisted the temptation to quip every third paragraph (it feels like). It feels forced.

    &lt;p&gt;
      The modern history of a nation that's been to some extent marginalised by wider geopolitics. It begins with domination by Japan in the late 19th century, which continued until the end of the Second World War – only to be replaced by domination through "trusteeship" by the US and others, which itself was a direct precursor to the partition of the nation, a vicious war, and a long and convoluted evolution of two very different political and economic outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are times when it feels a little superficial: the Korean War gets only a few pages. But that's a consequence of the breadth of coverage, and especially the time spent analysing the politics as they evolve through repression (in the North) and authoritarianism becoming dictatorship and finally vibrant and raucous democracy (in the South).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that both authors are Korea specialists (and in one case ethnically Korean) certainly helps. They have seen close-up the evolution of both Koreas' places in the world, and their personal observations and anecdotes bring the story alive without being distracting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last chapter is a detailed analysis of when and whether any re-unification of the pennisula will happen. It's a balanced and well-informed view, albeit one that's too sanguine with respect to the expectation of continued US support and engagement: the recent (as I write) events in Ukraine don't give confidence in whether the US would act as an honest broker in any crisis. But it remains a clear and well-reasoned (if largely non-committal) analysis of where Krean history may go next.

	  (2023)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What does it mean for someone to have a double? That is the broad premise of this book, and its a lot broader than it first appears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klein's doppelganger is another author, Naomi Wolf. Both began as liberal and feminist darlings, before "Other Naomi" (Wolf) became a proponent of various consipracy theories and hanging out with right-wing influencers. The two Naomis starte being confused with each other within social media, to the estent that Klein almost starts to lose her own sense of identity and becomes increasingly obsessed with tracking the confusion. (I was darkly amused to check Wolf out on &lt;a&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and find that the page starts "Not to be confused with Naomi Klein" – and &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt; for Klein's entry.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a certain feeling of narcissism in the account. Maybe Klein is affected so much because she and Wolf both have such curated on-line personalities, so that when Klein's is intruded upon it feels like a personal attack. Would someone with less commitment to media be so affected? – well, I have to say I hope I never personally find out, because it comes across as a very destabilising experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klein does take a broader view of the pheonomenon of "doubling", which at one level feels unnecessary ad extraneous to this book but that I found quite fascinating in its own right: the idea that doubles appear in lots of circumstances for those with (and even without) a life in the public eye. For an author it's natural to be worried about how the "double" that is one's written work is interpreted and re-interpreted after it's been published, without your control, and how this spills-back on to how people interpret everything you write from then on. Some of the examples feel a little contrived, others quite plausible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this book is both a personal memoir and a deeper exploration of a person's relationship to their own work and life. Both sides are valuable and well worth reading.

	Stuart Russell
	  (2019)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A book that tries to address the emergence and implications of artificial intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I should preface what I'm going to say by noting Brand's enormous contributions to AI research and teaching. He knows massively more about these systems than I do.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Computer scientists often avoid the term "AI" because it's so broad and encompasses a huge range of approaches, from constraint-solving and pattern-matching to speech recognition and the sorts of "chatbot" technology that is the common face of modern AI – technically referred to as Large Language Models or LLMs, that have been trained on text scraped from the internet and can perform impressive feats of conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a problem when discussing AI that you have to be very careful about, and that's the tendency to anthropomorphise. It's almost impossble not to use terms that imply agency: "think", "understand", "learn", "know", "decide", and so on. AI researchers use these words with very technical senses that are analogous to their usual meanings – but that aren't the same, and that's where things get misleading. When a person "summarises" some information, we mean that they pick out what they think is most important from the text; when an LLM does the same thing, it picks out the words that are statistically most clustered within the text and its training data. Are these two processes the same? They certainly don't &lt;i&gt;sound&lt;/i&gt; the same, and they often produce radically different "summaries", because the human summariser is working from a far richer knowledge base and using different means to assess importance, often including what they know about the intended audience. It's doing this well that's usually taken as one of the hallmarks of intelligence. These are statistical techniques that cleave to the mean, which implies they will always &lt;i&gt;by design&lt;/i&gt; produce middling answers. An amazingly insightful and creative answer is by definition unlikely, and so will be avoided &lt;i&gt;by design&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other problems too. Machine learning, the science that underlies LLMs, is usually based on training from huge volumes of data. This permits impressive feats, such as being able to spot anomalies in cancer images better (in some cases) and more consistently than trained doctors. But that's a weakness too: the idea that &lt;i&gt;the future will be like the past&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that anything not in the training set runs the risk of being ignored as noise. The LLMs' training data from the internet is &lt;i&gt;text&lt;/i&gt;, not validated &lt;i&gt;knowledge&lt;/i&gt; in any sense. And remember that repetition increases likelihood for an LLM, including repeatition of nonsense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This lies at the heart of the problem of hallucination, where AIs confidently produce startlingly incorrect text. Why is this? Because text is all they have to work with: there is no model of the world as it is, and therefore no ability to correct. The most modern LLMs are now attempting to correct this, so far with little success. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So are we seeing intelligence from LLMs? We're seeing something that &lt;i&gt;presents&lt;/i&gt; like &lt;i&gt;some parts of&lt;/i&gt; such intelligence. From this the industry has extrapolated that we are, for example, about to see models demonstrating "PhD level" ability – "soon", but there never seems to be a demonstration. One characteristic of LLMs is that they don't spontaneously do &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;: they wait until prompted, and then reply. Does that sound like intelligent behaviour? – no planning, no forethought, no imagination? I work with a lot of PhD-level people, and &lt;i&gt;none of them&lt;/i&gt; behave this way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some will object that there's lots going on in industrial labs that we don't see. Quite possibly. Maybe the insiders are seeing things that we outsiders don't. But the common characteristic of the systems we outsiders &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; see is systems that can perform well on certain well-prescribed and -bounded tasks, but which then fail catastrophically when used in less constrained domains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am a materialist: I don't believe that there's anything supernatural about intelligence (however one defines it), or anything privileged about running an intelligent process on a biological (rather than a silicon) substrate. But this book strikes me as another over-hyped, somewhat confused and confusing contribution to our understanding of what AI is. It focuses on some entirely hypothetical potential harms (intelligent autonomous machines) while largely ignoring the very real current harms of bias, accuracy, and increasing economic and digital disparities.

    &lt;p&gt;
      A book using colour as a way to access a range of other topics, without ever losing focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the choices will probably be controversial, such as the emergence of "whiteness" as a racial classification, even though supported plentifully by evidence. There are plenty of other less challenging anecdotes, though. Why do we usually consider there that there are &lt;i&gt;seven&lt;/i&gt; colours? – at least in part because of Newton's religious and alchemical ideas that led him to want to tie colour to the notes on the musical scale&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I most enjoyed the chapter on purple, mainly because it focused on the significant technological change that synthetic aniline dyes brought into culture, changing the relative abundances of various colours and changing the ways in which they were perceived as signifiers of wealth and status.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Food &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; food-shaped industrial products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultra-processed food (UPF) is pervasive in modern diets, and with it comes a litany of actual, conjectured, and supposed harms. UPF itself is a strange beast, taking food crops and turning them into pure components that can then be re-mixed to construct new products. This has some perverse consequences, such as flavours being removed from purified and "modified" oils and starches in order to make them more broadly usable – and then having &lt;i&gt;those same flavours&lt;/i&gt; re-introduced later in the process, again in "modified" form. That sounds insane – how can it be cheaper than using the original oil? – but in fact it makes perfet commercial sense for companies wanting fungible raw materials to produce unvarying, known-ahead-of-time tastes and textures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The resulting products (I'm now reluctant to call them foods), being created in labs, can be re-worked in pursuit of particular commercial goals, for example by adding powdered soya when looking to create a "high-protein" snack. They can also be re-engineered to be far more pleasurable and addictive for consumers, for example by hacking the body's responses to food (which are themselves coming to be understood as far more subtle and complicated than we used to think).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;van Tulleken has a science background, and it shows in the writing: most of the claims are carefully framed and evidenced. His background also saves him from falling for the industry's faux-refutations about there not being definitive causal links to specific harms: randomised controlled trials &lt;i&gt;aren't&lt;/i&gt; the "scientific gold standard" in situations where they're impossible to conduct in the real world, and epidemiological evidence coupled with some knowledge of the possible harm pathways can provide sufficient evidence. Having said that, he does sometimes deviate from this careful path, and there are a few instances of words like "may" and "could" doing a lot of heavy lifting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most powerful elements of the book is that it simultaneously doesn't preach or prescribe, but does offer suggestions for ways forward. UPF is very difficult to precisely define, and is therefore difficult to legislate for or avoid. Does a single stabiliser in a product render it UPF? – because if so literally &lt;i&gt;anything in a packet&lt;/i&gt; would be included. van Tulleken also takes aim at some of the wider social drivers of UPF, notably its cheapness and ease of preparation compared to "real" food, reinforcing poor diet as a consequence of poverty. He also suggests some interesting policy options, while also taking aim at a policy infrastructure that's heavily co-opted by the UPF industry. Regulators and the food industry are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; partners and have goals that are mutually irreconcilable within the current framework of pre-eminent shareholder value.

    &lt;p&gt;
      The space race from the American perspective is well-known: this book presents the same race from the Soviet perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The differences are profound, of course, mainly driven by the Soviet programme occurring in complete secrecy to duck the risks that failure would have on the programme's image. The American programme by contrast was conducted in the open at least as far as the actual "shots" were concerned – and their public failures did indeed endanger their ability to continue, at least in part because neither public nor politicians understood the process of engineering or just how &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt; each shot was. The deep irony is that the Soviet successes appeared so sudden and dramatic they led directly to the deepening of the American programme and commitment or more money and effort than the Soviets seemed able to maintain to capitalise on their early lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are plenty of revelations even for those with a detailed interest in space history. I remember hearing all through the 1970s that the Soviet spacecraft landed on land, but it turns out that in many cases the cosmonauts were bailing-out and parachuting to earth instead, with this being intensively covered-up even to the extent of falsifying reports to the international organisation responsible for certifying "firsts" in space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the achievements of both programmes were profound, they were perhaps doomed in the long term by a lack of vision for what they were actually &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;. The benefits of space technology are now obvious; those of exploration perhaps less so, although it doesn't (in my opinion) require much suspension of disbelief to feel that science-driven activities lead almost inevitably to enormously valuable spin-offs. The fact that we can't quantify these &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; shouldn't (in my opinion, again) stop us keeping the faith in the value of experiments that advance our science &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; engineering in ways that wouldn't otherwise happen.

      It's unusual to read a book that probably couldn't have been written before &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; after it actually was: the political environment of China thawed just enough to give people confidence to speak to a foreign author about the events of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The horrors shine through, in the memories of the young Red Guards and their victims. But so too do the current sensitivities, not least in the rather farcical museums and monuments that can be found across China – but that can't be visited, because the custodians race to close them up "for maintenance" as soon as a visitor arrives. It's a different approach to that described in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50215644.Between_Two_Fires_Truth__Ambition__and_Compromise_in_Putin_s_Russia" title="Between Two Fires Truth, Ambition, and Compromise in Putin's Russia by Joshua Yaffa" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Between Two Fires: Truth, Ambition, and Compromise in Putin's Russia&lt;/a&gt;, where museums are re-assigned to new curators who subtly change their message, but it reinforces the fears that authoritarian regimes have of their own histories and those who might actually remember them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China has never had a public reckoning with the Cultural Revolution – and it doesn't look that it will have one for a long time. The message of this book is that this hiding of the past continues to do damage to the present, not least because it provides a vague and unexamined fear of disorder that can be used to justify repression "in case it happens again". But the fact is that it didn't just "happen": it was commanded, by a regime that's the linear predecessor of the current leadership who seem to want to both disown it &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; levarage it for their own ends.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      An insight into the British politics of the 2010s. And not a pretty sight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pitch for this book is that, as a political wife, the author had a unique ringside seat from which to observe the goings-on the (mostly male) politicians. And it's true that she has plenty of insight into them and into her own position in the circle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she also exposes herself as almost a caricature of a Tory. She accepts the misogyny and crudeness of the male MPs as just how it is, and utterly lacks any understanding of why anyone would disagree with her own positions. She can't accept, for example, that Remainers were sincere and their misgivings might be valid, or that the EU is anything other that fascinated with the idea of humiliating Britain. She constantly refers to the Labour party as "Marxists" and trots-out the usual tropes of how they would bankrupt the country, despite the fact that their "extreme left-wing" positions would be entirely mainstream in many European countries. She's clear-eyed and unenthusiastic about Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, but then fawns over him when he wins his election landslide and glides over the time-bomb he planted on the Irish border issue, even though this was evident at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The overwhelming theme, returned to again and again, is how self-interested the political class is, focused entirely on who's up, who's down, and how if affects their own careers. Lots of dinner parties, gentlemen's clubs, and holidays: one is left amazed by how shallow everyone is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not a bad book, and an enjoyably light read. But politically insightful it isn't, other than to highlight the trivial nature of politicians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merged review:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An insight into the British politics of the 2010s.

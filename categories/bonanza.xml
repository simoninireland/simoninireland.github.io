    &lt;p&gt;
      A history of books and reading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a deep and cleverly-constructed history, running from the invention of papyrus scrolls to their replacement by parchment (and later paper) books. The transition away from papyrus brought with it a huge increase in comvenience – but also in the longevity of works, in that the physical stability and portability of books made it less likely that all copies of a work would disappear. Manuscripts needed to be physically copied to create another copy that might survive independently of the original; scrolls needed to be copied because they otherwise disintegrate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Equally fascinating is the way books formed a central part of culture in the ancient world. I was particularly intrigued by the discussion of Roman libraries built in two rooms, one for the Latin and one for the Greek, and how the Romans saw and took up the challenges of Greek civilisation as a partial model (and counter-model) for their own. The centrality of literature to that endeavour is easy to overlook in more martial histories of Rome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's also interesting to see the ways in which things now commonplace were once technological innovations – such as tables of contents, library catalogues, punctuation, and the like. These were shaped by the capabilities &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; limitations of scrolls as a storage medium, and have persisted functionally unchanged down to the present day.

      A successor to &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25135194.Prisoners_of_Geography_Ten_Maps_That_Tell_You_Everything_You_Need_to_Know_About_Global_Politics" title="Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics by Tim Marshall" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics&lt;/a&gt; that attempts to do the same thing: to argue that geography constrains the pursuit of politics more than we might realise. It does this, although as a sequel it's far less impactful than the original, and seems to spend too much time on the historical progression of the chosen countries and not enough on the ways these histories actually manifest the geographical constraints under which they're constrained. Indeed, some of the countries' geographies (such as Saudi Arabia's) seem almost irrelevant compared to their geologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inclusion of "space" as a country is interesting from a political perspective, and Marshall does manage to show that it has a "geography" of sorts – as &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31528889.Robert_Heinlein" title="Robert Heinlein" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Robert Heinlein&lt;/a&gt; is quoted as saying, once you're in Earth orbit you're halfway to anywhere, since getting up the gravity well is the major transport cost. I'm assuming this will be the subject of a later book.

    &lt;p&gt;
      A book that I very much enjoyed, but that simultaneously made me quite anxious: if I had a heart condition it would have been unreadable, I suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operations chosen are all milestones, ranging from the very first surgeries up to heart transplants, stents, and other modern semi-miracles. The most interesting thing to me was the degree to which a lot of the action was performed in very small communities of doctors, often with very varying degrees of commitment and risk appetite: the same surgeons often re-appear in later innovations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The part that was most anxiety-inducing was that the translation from idea to successful implementation (or from science to engineering) was frequently log, drawn-out, and filled with dashed hopes and dead patients. I don't think it could be any other way given the complexities of the procedures being honed, but the names of the early subjects deserve to be at least as well-known as those of the surgeons, for their willingness to take a risk with their own lives in the interests of saving themselves, but also of eventually saving others eben if their own surgery failed.

      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A very enjoyable biography-cum-social history of how witchcraft and witch trials crossed from England and Europe to the young America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's in some ways easier to understand the hold that a fear of witches had in America than in the Old World of the same period. The settlers found themselves in a dangerous position, both in respect of the Native Americans whose lands they were encroaching on and of the lands themselves, which remained largely unknown and untamed. The instability this gave rise to made life less predictable, and so people looked for explanations through which to make sense of it – and preferred supernatural malignity to natural indifference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's also fascinating to see how complex and semi-feudal the interactions were between people in the newly-settled villages, but also between the townships that vied for control and influence. The fact that "witches" often went unconvicted and unpunished (if they moved away) suggests that the motives involved in their pursuit were neither purely religious nor especially prioritised.

    &lt;p&gt;
      A history of corporate interactions with government and customers: in particular, the rise and fall of idea of anti-monopoly and the different philosophies that underpin regulators in the US &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; Europe. The feeling is one of ... well, if not hopelessness, than of an inadequacy of democratic governance in the face of enormous corporate spending on lobbying and political influence to protect corporate greed and profit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's perhaps unfortunate that I read this at the moment when the corporations identified as the major threats – the tech giants – were busily shedding staff and possibly collapsing to a shadow of their former (and intended future) selves. It demonstrates that what sometimes feels like inevitable and inexorable triumph is often just a phase: that the largest, most successful, corporations are often brought low sooner and more unexpectedly than anyone could have conceived in the times of their pomp.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Does a fantastic job of explaining an essentially inexplicable movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;QAnon is a conspiracy theory like no other, one that subsumes other conspiracies and morphs into new shapes as its existing tropes and predictions fail to come to pass. It's hard to see it as anything other than a rejection of reason and modernity and the embrace of ... well, nonsense. Rothschild sees it as far more than that, and manages to dive into the abyss without ever becoming lost or tempted to become a believer. He traces the theory's development, from before the first Q "drops" until after Q's disappearence, and draws some historical parallels with previous movements whose failed predictions did little to damage their popularity.

    &lt;p&gt;
      A masterful telling of modern genetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you know about genetics is wrong: what's how it feels, anyway. The simple story about mutation and inheritance is ... well, not wrong exactly, but woefully incomplete. I think part of the problem is that we lack the right analogies. Genetics is &lt;i&gt;in no way&lt;/i&gt; a blueprint that's simply read when creating life, nor is it &lt;i&gt;in any way&lt;/i&gt; constructed like engineering. Instead it operates at the boundary of chaos, with multiple redundant (and often conflicting) mechanisms finding an uneasy hoeostasis. Genes aren't elementary packets of information, nor does most of the genome consist of them: nor, indeed, is there any well-agreed notion of what a gene actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;. The basic mechanism of RNA reading DNA and then being used to create proteins comes with a set of baroque extensions, as does the supposedly clear notion of heritable characteristics being frozen in the DNA itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all it's amazing that any of it is understood at all – let alone well enough to perform modifications and other feats of modern biotechnology. Arney in many ways achieves the impossible in this book, not hiding the complexity of dumbing it down for a popular audience, but also never getting lost or adding to the inevitable confusion that all this complexity induces even in a scientifically literate reader. I learned a huge amount and had several confusions sorted out for me (to the extent that they are understood at all).

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A book about pain, and why it isn't what we think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conventional wisdom is that pain is caused by damage, but it's more subtle than that. Pain is a &lt;i&gt;signal&lt;/i&gt; that can be triggered by damage, but can also be caused in response to less physical causes such as fear and a memory of past damage – and can be suppressed by activity or positive thinking, at least to a degree. This is awkward ground, as Lyman recognises: it's close to saying that "it's all in the mind", which is both literally true and deeply offensive to those suffering persistent pain. But it also offers hope that enormously dangerous pharmaceuticals can – sometimes – be replaced or complemented with cognitive therapies that might be effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has had the experience of being deeply engaged in some activity, incurring damage, and not noticing until afterwards. Soldiers frequently report it: they also sometimes feel significantly less pain from their injuries than civilians, because an injury that takes you off the battlefield makes you &lt;i&gt;safer than you were&lt;/i&gt;. The signals get mixed, and the pain felt changes accordingly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's much to like in this book, not least a very thorough treatment of placebos. It does sometimes get lost in reporting yet another clinical trial, or yet another insight into neurochemistry. It sometimes feels a little too long and too well-referenced for a popular science take on the issues.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A social and scientific history of human sound: not just undesired noise, but how sound binds societies together and how we decide what constitutes "noise" in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some fascinating vignettes. My favourite is the relationship between cave paintings and the soundscapes of the caves in which they're painted: many of the works occur in locations that are "significant" in the sounds that can be heard, or in the ways that sounds made there reverberate into the wider cave. There's also a discussion of colonial attitudes to the languages and music of indigenous peoples, and how the contempt for these (as "hellish din") contributed to the colonists' disdain for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As someone who loves silence, there are also some explorations that were awkward and discomforting for me, as to how the ability to find silence is a manifestation of "othering" others in society, and regarding their sounds as encroaching and unwanted. There's also a sense that the pursuits one enjoys in silence – like reading – often come about because the noise of their construction has been offloaded elsewhere, to impact on other people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to "noise", it seems to boil down to whether the sounds being heard are perceived as being made by "us" or "them", and to what extent we can exercise some control over them. That makes sound a part of the wider behaviour of a society: if we are all "us", then we will tackle excess sound differently than if those sounds are being made by a "them". In that sense, noise complaints are a measure of social cohesiveness and our willingness to rub along well with others.

    &lt;p&gt;
      A history of the Theranos blood-testing scandal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theranos was once the hottest Silicon Valley property. There seem to have been several reasons for this, one of which was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; its technology, which was largely undemonstrated and unproven – and which turned out to be entirely fictitious (or "vapourware", in software terms). But it had a charismatic CEO who self-consciously fashioned herself on Steve Jobs, and an origin story phrased in terms of "disrupting" an existing industry that was worth billions. That, it seems, was enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is really a story of how a weird corporate culture managed to silence its critics within and without. Those within often &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; something was wrong, especially those with experience in other start-ups. Those without were either threatened or bought off. But it's shocking to what extent many senior people seemed quite content to represent, advise, and profit from a company while being contentedly ignorant of what its product actually &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The executives in charge have faced the courts, and their defence seemed largely to be that "fake it 'till you make it" was a valid new-economy strategy. I have some sympathy with the idea, and they certainly weren't the first group to try it. Where they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; perhaps more innovative was in trying this with a healthcare device, probably the most regulated business niche and not a place to attempt a fraud. Perhaps their enthusiasm ran away with them, but there's plenty in this book that illuminates shady practices and ruthlessness that don't make them look at all sypathetic.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

I've spent much of this week working with MSc students writing their dissertations, and this has inevitably led to the part of a dissertation that often causes the most pain to write (and read, for that matter): the abstract.

What is the abstract of a report or paper? What it &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; is an introduction or guide to the rest of the document: that, unsurprisingly, is what the introduction is for. The goal of an abstract is much simpler: it's intended to persuade the reader to read some or all of the rest of the document. It may be surprising that this is an issue, but in a world in the grip of an information explosion it's clear that readers' attention is a limiting quantity in information processing. As a reader, should you bother to read a paper? Or not? And how do you make this decision?

Many new researchers, when confronted with a paper, start at the front and work forward. More experienced researchers know this is a mistake that leads to reading whole tracts of irrelevance or nonsense. (The former is worse: nonsense at least has occasional entertainment value.) This leads many people (myself included) to adopt a non-linear reading style:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Read the abstract&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If still interested, read the conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; interested, read the introduction&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If it's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interesting, read the rest of the paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
(There are several variants, a couple of which are described &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/top_science-fair_how_to_read_a_scientific_paper.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Read-a-Scientific-Paper" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) The point here is that we can filter out papers of lesser interest to reserve time and head space for the most interesting. Only if the results grab your attention do you need to spend time discovering the detail of how they were obtained -- rather than doing that work only discover that you don't care about the results being reported.

The abstract is the key: without a decent description of what the paper is about, the discerning reader will not proceed even to the introduction, and therefore any work contained in the paper will remain unread -- and therefore be largely worthless.

So how does one write a decent abstract? Most experienced scientists have their own technique, and the approach does need to vary from field to field and for different paper styles: a review paper is different to a piece of primary research. The approach I've come to rely on for research in computer science and mathematics can be described succinctly as &lt;strong&gt;the five-sentence abstract&lt;/strong&gt;. I've found five sentences seems to be about optimal, structured as follows:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;The area of the paper (1 sentence).&lt;/span&gt; The problem area to which this paper makes a contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: orange"&gt;The issue the paper addresses (1 sentence).&lt;/span&gt; Presumably the area is not yet fully explored, and you've found a problem that needs tackling -- otherwise what's in your paper?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;What you've done, the results you've obtained (2 sentences).&lt;/span&gt; The key contribution of the paper, what you've added to practice and/or knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;What this means (1 sentence).&lt;/span&gt; Why should anyone care?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Let's do an example, from a paper I've always wanted to write about finding unicorns:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;There are lots of interesting animals out there, many of which have horns.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: orange"&gt;No-one has yet reported observing any one-horned horses, however.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;We describe our research survey of the horses of the West of Ireland. While we found many horses, and many other horned animals, we failed to locate any horned horses.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;We conclude that further research is required to find unicorns, preferably in an equally pleasant holiday destination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
OK, perhaps not a great example. Let's try another, from a real paper:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;In the domain of ubiquitous computing, the ability to identify the occurrence of situations is a core function of being context-aware.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: orange"&gt;Given the uncertain nature of sensor information and inference rules, reasoning techniques that cater for uncertainty hold promise for enhancing the reasoning process.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;In our work, we apply the Dempster Shafer theory of evidence to infer situation occurrence with the minimal use of training data. We describe a set of evidential operations for sensor mass functions using context quality and evidence accumulation for continuous situation detection.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;We demonstrate how our approach enables situation inference with uncertain information using a case study based on a published smart home data set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(Taken from McKeever, Ye, Coyle and Dobson. &lt;a href="http://www.simondobson.org/softcopy/ds-situation-inference-eurossc-09.pdf"&gt;Using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence for situation inference&lt;/a&gt;. In Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Smart Sensing and Context (EuroSSC). Volume 5741 of LNCS. Springer-Verlag. Guildford, UK. 2009.) The abstract goes from domain to challenge to approach to significance: having read it, the reader hopefully has a fairly good idea of what the paper contributes to which domain, and why this contribution is significant (in the authors' minds, at least).

Shorter is often better, of course:
&lt;div title="Page 1"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Wireless sensor networks are attracting increasing interest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: orange"&gt;but suffer from severe challenges such as power constraints and low data reliability. Sensors are often energy-hungry and cannot operate over the long term, and the data they gather are frequently erroneous in complex ways. The two problems are linked, but existing work typically treats them independently:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;in this paper we consider both side-by-side,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;and propose a self-organising solution for model-based data collection that reduces errors and communications in a unified fashion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
(From Fang and Dobson. &lt;a href="http://www.simondobson.org/softcopy/iwsos-faults-energy.pdf"&gt;Unifying sensor fault detection with energy conservation&lt;/a&gt;. In Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Self-Organising Systems (IWSOS'13). Palma de Mallorca, ES. May 2013.) In this case my student Lei messed with the sentence structure because we wanted to get across the idea that the main problem was the totality of the existing approach to the problem, which we wanted to address as a whole. The abstract still follows the basic structure, and I think is stronger for being shorter.

No rule of writing is hard-and-fast, of course, and so you'll often find great abstracts that adopt a completely different approach. I don't think this matters so much as ensuring that the abstract is fit for purpose: an enticement to read further.</description><category>university</category><category>writing</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/2013/08/18/abstracts/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 12:03:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hypothetical adventures in your chosen field</title><link>https://simondobson.org/2013/01/19/hypothetical-adventures-chosen-field/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A discussion on the different styles of PhD thesis that might be
appropriate for different students and research areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to one of my students about the "shape" of their PhD,
and how we might present the work they're doing in the final thesis.
This particular student is working on the science of complex coupled
networks, which is a very new area of network science -- itself a
pretty new field. The exact details of her work aren't important: the
important point is that it's an area that's so poorly understood that
it's hard to ask meaningful detailed questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PhD is a training in research: the work done in the course of one
doesn't usually change the world, and a fact that's often forgotten is
that &lt;em&gt;they're not supposed to&lt;/em&gt;. The goal of a PhD is to
demonstrate that the candidate can conceive of, plan, conduct,
evaluate a communicate a programme of research, sustained over
typically three or four years, that adds something to human knowledge.
Clearly there are many ways one can demonstrate this, and the question
we were asking was: what are the variations? How do we choose which is
appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical thesis is a monograph, written specially to describe the
research, its process and results. In this it's very different from a
scientific paper, which typically focuses on a single result and often
elides a lot of the motivation and process. Publications along the way
always help, of course: they let a reader (or examiner) know that the
work being presented has been reviewed by others in the field, which
always gives a certain amount of confidence that it contains
worthwhile results. (Few things make a PhD examiner's heart sink more
than a thesis with no associated publications. It means you're on your
own in terms of assessing every aspect of the work.) The monograph
needs a "shape", a skeleton upon which to hang the research, as well
as clearly-enumerated contributions to knowledge and an understanding
of its own boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are however a couple of different styles of skeletal structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hypothesis.&lt;/strong&gt; This is my favourite, truth be told.
The work is encapsulated in a question, and the rest of the thesis
seeks to answer this question. The answer might be yes, no, or maybe,
all of which can be valid and can result in the award of a degree. The
research then proves the hypothesis, disproves it, narrows it down as
incomplete, or uncovers extra structure that would require
substantially more work to explore -- or some combination of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons to like this style of thesis. Firstly, the
hypothesis is usually something concrete within the field of study.
(It may seem hopelessly abstract to anyone outside the field, of
course.) That makes it easy for an examiner or other reader to relate
to: the question makes sense to them, as something one would want to
know the answer to. Secondly -- and more importantly -- you have a
pretty clear goal and consequently a pretty good notion of when you're
finished. A PhD can almost always go on for ever, of course, but
having a tight hypothesis means that you have a reference against
which to test the work and decide whether it's sufficient to convince
the reader of your conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this we may contrast the second type of thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventures in your chosen field.&lt;/strong&gt; In this kind of
thesis, there is no hypothesis. Instead, the thesis marks-out an area
of interest and explores it, with a view to understanding or
characterising some or all of it but without any driving question that
demands an answer. Unlike the hypothesis, this kind of thesis isn't
really "for" anything: it's intended as an exploration, a search for
features -- and indeed possibly for hypotheses to be tested in the
future. But this style of thesis is perfect for some areas, like
mathematics and the more abstract end of computer science, where
something new needs to be explored for a while to see if it makes
sense and what is has to offer. (It's also found in non-monographical
theses, where some universities allow candidates to submit a portfolio
of published papers in place of the traditional approach. I must say I
always find theses like these quite disjointed and fundamentally
dissatisfying: there's a lot to be said for a purpose-written, rounded
monograph as a conclusion to a programme of research.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would probably have to admit that an "adventures" thesis is a
little more challenging to examine, since it doesn't motivate its own
intention as clearly as a "hypothetical" thesis. It's going to be
harder for the candidate to decide when it's ready, too, since one can
always do &lt;em&gt;just one more&lt;/em&gt; search to find something else of
interest. In that sense, an "adventurer" needs to be more disciplined
both in deciding when enough is enough and in deciding what, of the
many possible choices, constitute the interesting pathways to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think either style is inherently preferable. It depends
entirely on the subject matter, and one could easily fall into the
mistake of trying to construct a hypothesis for work that was really
an "adventure", or indeed not constructing one for a thesis that
really needed one to motivate and structure it. There's a clear
difference between an exploratory thesis and a rambling one: the
exploration needs structure and coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also perhaps worth considering the psychologies and research
styles of different students. Some students need concrete goals: to
build something, to test something, to prove or disprove a conjecture.
These people clearly benefit from doing "hypothetical" theses. Other
students have an interest in an area rather than in any specific
outcome, and so might prefer an "adventure". There's no point in
forcing one into the other, any more than one can get a
theoretically-inclined student motivated by coding (and the associated
debugging): it's just not what floats their boat, and it's better that
they know their own minds, strengths and interests than to spend three
or four years engaged in a quest to which they're fundamentally
misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>phd</category><category>writing</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/2013/01/19/hypothetical-adventures-chosen-field/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2013 13:01:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why I research</title><link>https://simondobson.org/2011/02/23/why-i-research/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I came across George Orwell's 1946 essay &lt;em&gt;Why I write&lt;/em&gt;. Some of his reasons for writing resonate with some of my reasons for doing research.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

I wasn't expecting that. Research involves writing, of course, and reading too -- enormous amounts of both -- but it's not the same kind of writing as a &lt;em&gt;writer&lt;/em&gt; writes. While it's good to have a clear style in science, it's the clarity of the science and not the turn of phrase that's the most prized element of scientific writing.

Orwell, writing in 1946 (which is post &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal farm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, incidentally), sets out the forces that led him to become a writer. Specifically, he identifies "four great motives for writing" that will drive each writer in different proportion depending on who he is, when and what he's writing about. Reading these, it struck me how close they are to the reasons I (and I suspect others) have for doing research:

&lt;strong&gt;Sheer egoism. &lt;/strong&gt;That's one any academic &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to agree with. A desire to be thought clever, talked about, and be remembered. For some, in some fields, there's a seduction towards popular commentary. For others it's a more academic draw, to be the centrepoint of conferences or to be head-hunted into bigger and better (and better-paid) jobs. As long as the pleasure of recognition doesn't get in the way of the science I don't think it does any harm, although we always need to keep in mind that it's really all about the research and not about the researcher -- a little &lt;em&gt;memento mori&lt;/em&gt; for the honest scientist.

&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetic enthusiasm. &lt;/strong&gt;It might surprise some people to hear about aesthetics applied to science, but it's certainly an aspect of the experience: the pleasure in thoughts well-set-down, of an elegant and complete explanation of something. Especially in mathematics there's a clear and well-recognised link between simplicity and the perception of beauty, a feeling that the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; approach is the one that captures all the essence of a problem as simply as possible. It's surprising how often such simplicity works, and how often it leads directly to unexpected complexity and interactions.

&lt;strong&gt;Historical impulse. &lt;/strong&gt;Orwell uses this in the sense of "a desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity." In sciences I think one can also see in this a desire to bring together strands of past work (your own and others'), and again to make a clean and elegant synthesis of whatever field one works in. I think it also encompasses the need we have to share science, to have papers in durable venues like journals as well as in live conference events.

&lt;strong&gt;Political purpose. &lt;/strong&gt;The desire to push the world in a particular direction. Scientists are often accused of being remote from the real world, although a lot of what we do &lt;a href="https://simondobson.org/2010/05/grey-philistines/"&gt;is increasingly influencing public policy&lt;/a&gt;. This element of writing also led Orwell to the most famous line of the whole essay: "The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude." Few senior scientists would disagree nowadays.

It's surprising to me that a writer and a scientist could agree on their driving purposes to this extent. I suspect it's simply because of the need for creativity that underlies both spheres, and the fact that both are essentially self-motivated and self-driven. You become a writer because it's who you are, not because of what you'll get out of it, although you also obviously hope that the rewards will flow somehow; similarly for science.

What I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have, of course -- and I'm  grateful for it -- is the equivalent of the trauma Orwell suffered in the Spanish Civil War, which shaped his subsequent writing and give him a lifelong cause against totalitarianism. It certainly makes me want to read &lt;a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homage to Catalonia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; again, though, and I'll read it with a new view on how it came about.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>research</category><category>writing</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/2011/02/23/why-i-research/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2011 08:00:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How to publish an unpopular book?</title><link>https://simondobson.org/2011/01/10/unpopular-book/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about writing a book. It won't be a popular success -- trust me -- but that raises the question of how I should publish it.

&lt;!--more--&gt;I've never written a book, although I've written a lot of papers and edited a couple of conference proceedings and other collections: writing is one of the things academics do for a living. But I've been thinking for a while about writing a book on how to build a programming language. This isn't something that JK Rowling (my neighbour in Morningside) needs to worry will eat into her royalties, obviously, but it's something that'd be of interest to a certain group of people. I've been teaching programming, compilers, language principles and the like for several years, and have sometimes shown classes how to build interpreters and compilers from the ground up. I'd like to share this with a wider audience, and show how the tools and techniques of languages can be used to make a whole class of problems easier and more fun to solve. There's something very liberating and exciting (to me, anyway) about understanding the tools of programming in their most raw, and of being able to change them to suit particular circumstances. It also brings a new perspective to &lt;a href="https://simondobson.org/2010/06/monads-language-design-perspective/"&gt;things one might encounter in particular languages&lt;/a&gt;, that can encourage experimentation and invention and the &lt;a href="https://simondobson.org/2010/03/forth-for-sensors/"&gt;re-purposing of tools to new domains&lt;/a&gt;.

It's not the writing that's the problem: the problem is the publishing. Clearly, no matter how excited &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; get about these things, it's going to be a pretty minority interest: not even most computer scientists write compilers. So it's hardly going to be a best-seller. But that then raises an interesting question. Traditional book publishing is about getting visibility and distribution for your work, with a view to maximising circulation, impact and royalties. If there's no money to be had, and the target audience is by definition computer- and internet-aware, are there better ways of getting the same (or better) visibility, distribution and impact, and reaching the audience more effectively than one can by traditional means?

What, in the 21st century, is the most effective way to publish an unpopular book?

In one way the internet answers this question in an obvious way: put a file on a web server. But that still leaves the visibility and impact parts to be solved -- and there are half-a-dozen ways to make the text available on a web server, too. We can split the problem between these two parts, though: how to write and represent the text, and how to let people know it's there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Distribution and format&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Web site. &lt;/strong&gt;A lot of books have associated web sites, for errata and additional material, sometimes freely available and sometimes behind a paywall. Clearly one could put a whole book up on a site, as well as any associated software, with a suitable licence to allow for downloading and whatever copying seems permissible. I use this approach for this site: all the content is under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/"&gt;Creative Commons licence&lt;/a&gt; that allows non-commercial sharing with attribution, and allows re-mixing as long as the derived work is also shared under the same or similar terms.

Most web sites require that you be on-line to read them, although that's not necessarily the case for systems like &lt;a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com"&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt; that download in one file. And one can get all the benefits of non-linear browsing and re-purposing by using proper hypertext as opposed to PDF.

&lt;strong&gt;E-book. &lt;/strong&gt;E-books have a lot to recommend them, especially their portability and download-ability. PDF is a popular format, but &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB"&gt;EPUB&lt;/a&gt; is probably a better choice: you get reflowing, hyperlinking and portability to small devices with no effort, in a way that's hard for a PDF.

Of course these formats aren't mutually exclusive, and one could easily come up with a writing system that can generate PDF, EPUB and indeed HTML from the same sources.

&lt;strong&gt;Blog.&lt;/strong&gt; The above are still fairly traditional approaches, varying in terms of delivery medium. What about blogging a book, allowing it to evolve over time?

I can think of one immediate disadvantage, which would be the danger of a lack of flow and a disjointedness that comes from not wrapping-up a work as a single entity. But of course there are some significant advantages: there's no reason one couldn't write large chunks of text and them blog them over time, and refine the text using comments before generating an e-book or re-linking into a more conventional web site.

&lt;strong&gt;Wiki/group blog.&lt;/strong&gt; If we accept the no money/lots of copying philosophy, then perhaps there's no reason to be precious about authorship either. A group blog or a wiki that encourages participation and updating might make sense: a sort of Wikipedia for programming languages, in which chapters can be commented on and edited by a community (if one forms). This might generate a work that's more complete than one I could wrote myself, if one got contributions from the appropriate, knowledgeable people. It could also degenerate into a farce without clear editing guidelines and proper curation: essentially the problems of a normal blog, writ large.

Wikis, and especially Wikipedia, often get trashed by academics. This isn't an opinion I completely share. At their best, wikis harness the best people with an interest in a subject. Their content needs protection from the stupid, vain, deluded, vicious and malicious, but none of that outweighs the benefits of having &lt;em&gt;potentially every expert in the world&lt;/em&gt; contributing. A traditional encyclopaedia is not necessarily more reliable -- look up "anthropology" in an early &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/em&gt; to see how fallible expert opinion is to modern eyes -- and with care there's no reason why a wiki need be less exacting than a more traditional medium. (Encyclopaediae aren't a good way to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; a subject, for which you really need a structured and knowledgeable guide -- but that's another story.)
&lt;h4&gt;Visibility&lt;/h4&gt;
Visibility subsumes impact, in a sense: if something is very visible and easily-found, then it's popularity is a direct measure of its significance in its community of interest. And if something is highly visible and still unpopular: well, that's just something to live with. We can split visibility between pull and push: people finding what they're looking for &lt;em&gt;versus&lt;/em&gt; being told that there's something they might be interested in.

&lt;strong&gt;SEO. &lt;/strong&gt;Search engine optimisation has evolved from being a valuable skill, through a commodity, to an arms race in which sites try to get search engines to notice them and search engines try not to be manipulated away from whatever they regard as their core metric for importance. (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"&gt;PageRank&lt;/a&gt; in the case of Google.) Most content managers have SEO packages built-in or available that can help.

&lt;strong&gt;Blogs. &lt;/strong&gt;There are a number of great programming language blogs out there, through which one could solicit help and readers. If the internet does anything, it's demonstrate that any small community or interest is globally large -- or at least large enough to keep most people happy. Even language hackers.

&lt;strong&gt;Software.&lt;/strong&gt; For a book about writing languages, I suspect the most effective advertisement is the software that one can develop with the techniques described, or the tools one could use to follow them. The sincerest recommendation is for the software to be used, found useful, and improved by someone else, who's then willing to share their experiences back with the net.

Having written all of the above, I'm still not sure where it leaves me. I'd welcome any comments or descriptions of experiences before I start putting hand to keyboard in the wrong way. Who'd have thought it's be so complicated? -- although I must say that having these sorts of choices is in itself a major draw, and a great indication of how the web's changing the world.</description><category>programming</category><category>writing</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/2011/01/10/unpopular-book/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2011 08:00:04 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

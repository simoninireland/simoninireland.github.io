&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
What &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a meta-object protocol? – or indeed a meta-object? This
book is perhaps the clearest exposition of these ideas.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In most modern object-oriented languages an object is an instance
of a class. In keeping with using objects throughout, classes are
often also objects (or can be thought of as such), but are more
informatively thought of as &lt;b&gt;meta-objects&lt;/b&gt; that to facilitate the
construction of "real" objects. The methods on classes can also be
thought of as meta-objects defining the code executed by the
objects when invoked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The defining feature of CLOS is that these meta-objects are all
just Lisp objects, but objects that exist "off-stage" (to use this
book's very intuitive metaphor) and largely invisible to a basic
user. But they're as available to a power user as any other
objects: the "meta"-ness is a matter of design, not of
implementation. The interactions between objects and meta-objects,
for example which methods are called when invoked on a particular
object, are defined by the meta-object protocol (MOP), which is
itself defined in terms of methods on the meta-objects that shadow
the objects themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Meta-object &lt;i&gt;protocol&lt;/i&gt; uses a term common in a lot of the earlier
object-oriented literature to mean a collection of functions:
meta-object &lt;i&gt;API&lt;/i&gt; would be a more modern rendering, although the
protocol includes the sequencing of API calls and their
relationships.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The goal of MOP programming is to let the programmer extend the
programming language towards to application domain, by automating
a lot of boilerplate code and providing the structures needed to
re-structure or analyse the code the programmer actually needs to
write. In this sense it's a continuation of the idea of macros as
powerful and potentially very domain-specific language and
compiler extensions. It's also a continuation of reifying
underlying language mechanisms in the language itself where they
can be re-specified and re-mixed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first part of the book explains MOPs by defining a slightly
simplified version of CLOS ("Closette"). It assumes the reader
knows some CLOS, for example from &lt;a href="/2024/07/23/object-oriented-programming-on-common-lisp-a-programmer1s-guide-to-clos/"&gt;Object-oriented
programming on Common Lisp: A programmer's guide to CLOS&lt;/a&gt; (or
there's a stand-alone introduction in Appendix A), but it &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;
assumes the knowledge level of a relative newcomer – and the
features then defined in Closette are just those parts of CLOS
that such a user would actually know and be comfortable with,
which is a brilliant piece of pedagogy that simplifies without
trivialising. It's really noticeable that Closette doesn't need
any extensions to Common Lisp: it's defined directly in the
language itself, which shows how powerful the underlying language
is. (Full CLOS requires a bit of language support too, at least
for efficiency.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next come several examples of MOP usage, for example to re-define
how classes store their slots, or how to add attributes to slots
that can store metadata about their use or could be used to
provide higher-level operations. There's also a long discussion
about protocol design and how this has a massive impact on how
easy a system is to use for the programmer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second part is a manual for the CLOS MOP, which is thorough
and useful, but perhaps less exciting than the first part. The
Common Lisp package &lt;a href="https://github.com/pcostanza/closer-mop"&gt;closer-mop&lt;/a&gt; provides this API as a
portable compatibility layer for use in real programs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There's also a discussion of practicalities like where awkward
circularities occur and how to break them, which is actually a
great example how to do good protocol/API design. In an example of
&lt;a href="/2024/07/23/the-roots-of-lisp/"&gt;Paul Graham's dictum&lt;/a&gt; that modern languages evolve by mixing Lisp
concepts into a different base, MOP ideas appear in lots of other
languages, either for real (Smalltalk, at to a lesser extent
&lt;a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2015/02/09/understanding-python-metaclasses/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;) or just for introspection (Java). Even someone not
planning on writing Lisp would benefit from reading this book just
to see the ideas in their full generality.
&lt;/p&gt;

Programmer’s Guide to CLOS&lt;/i&gt;. Addison-Wesley. ISBN 0-201-17589-4. 1989.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The definitive practical guide to using the Common Lisp Object
System (CLOS). It's written from a similar perspective to other
object-oriented tutorials, which makes it very accessible for
those who've had experience with something like Java or Python.
However, CLOS &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; just objects in Lisp, and &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; in any sense
just an object-oriented extension. It can take some time to change
mindset enough to use it properly, and this book is a great guide
to the core differences.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Firstly, it follows a completely different model of how to
associate functions with data. Instead CLOS uses "generic"
functions, where the exact code called is dispatched dynamically
based on the types of any or all parameters: so it's perfectly
possible to have several definitions of the &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; generic function
operating on objects of the &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; class, but taking arguments of
&lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; types. This &lt;i&gt;multiple dispatch&lt;/i&gt; is a lot more flexible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second point actually follows from this. CLOS' generic
functions can be defined to &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; Lisp types: in fact they're not
statically associated with classes at all, and can operate on &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt;
types (classes or not) across the type hierarchy. This makes it
closer to Haskell's type classes than to Smalltalk's (or Java's)
virtual methods, which are strongly bound to classes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thirdly, CLOS methods can be combined in a range of interesting
ways, not simply by overriding previous definitions – and indeed
you can define your own if you need to. And like Smalltalk
(but unlike Java) CLOS classes have "metaclasses" that can
re-define their basic functions. &lt;a href="/2024/07/23/the-art-of-the-metaobject-protocol"&gt;The art of the metaobject protocol&lt;/a&gt;
is a better source for this level of detail.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The examples in the book delve into these features by means of
sensibly-sized challenges that can be used to illustrate both
basic design and implementation. and more advanced ideas like
re-defining classes on the fly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

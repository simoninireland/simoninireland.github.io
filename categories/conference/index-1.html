<strong>Call for papers

Workshop on Dynamic Distributed Data-Intensive Applications, Programming Abstractions, and Systems (3DAPAS)</strong>
<div>To be held in conjunction with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hpdc.org/2011/" target="_blank">HPDC-2011</a>, 8 June 2011, San Jose, CA</div>

<div>There  has been a lot of effort in managing and distributing tasks where  computational loads are dominant. Such applications have after all, been  historically the drivers of "grid" computing.  There has, however, been  relatively less effort on tasks where the computational load is matched  by the data load, or even dominated by the data load. For such tasks to  be able to operate at scale, there are conceptually simple run-time  trade-offs that need to be made, such as determining whether to move  data to compute versus keeping data localized and move computational  tasks to operate on the data in situ, or possibly neither, and with data  regenerated on-the-fly. Due to fluctuating resource availability and  capabilities, as well as insufficient prior information about  application requirements, such decisions must be made at run-time.  Furthermore, resource, connectivity and/or storage constraints may  require the data to be manipulated in-transit so that it is "made-right"  for the consumer. Currently it is very difficult to implement these  dynamic decisions or the underlying mechanisms in a general-purpose and  scalable fashion.
<div>
<div>Although   the increasing volumes and complexity of data will make many problems  data load dominated, the computational requirements will still be high.   In practice, data-intensive applications will encompass data-driven  applications.  For example, many data-driven applications will involve  computational activities triggered as a consequence of independently  created data; thus it is imperative for an application to be able to  respond  to unplanned changes in data load or content.  Therefore, understanding  how to support dynamic computations is a fundamental, but currently  missing element in data-intensive computing.This   workshop will operate at the triple point of dynamic and distributed  and data-intensive (3D) attributes. This workshop will operate at the  triple point of dynamic, distributed and data-intensive (3D) attributes.  It will also focus on innovative approaches for scalability in the  end-to-end real-time processing of scientific data. We refer to 3D  applications as those  are data-intensive, need to support and respond to dynamic data, and,  either are  fundamentally, or need to be, distributed. We are interested in papers  that span the spectrum from the design of cyberinfrastructure to support  3D applications, to novel application examples. We are also looking to  bring researchers together to look at holistic, rather than piecewise,  approaches to the end-to-end processing and managing of scientific data.

3DAPAS  builds upon a 3 year research theme on Distributed Programming  Abstractions (DPA), which has held a series of related workshops (see: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/Distributed_Programming_Abstractions#Past_Events" target="_blank">DPA Past Events</a>) including  but not limited to e-Science2008, EuroPar 2008 and the CLADE series.  3DAPAS will also draw on ideas from the ongoing <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/3DPAS" target="_blank">3DPAS</a> Research Theme funded by the NSF and UK EPSRC.

<p>Papers are invited in all aspects of software engineering for adaptive systems, for the SEAMS symposium in Hawaii in May 2011. The deadline is now quite close.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS</strong></p>
<p><strong> 6th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS 2011)</strong>
(Sponsored by ACM SIGSOFT and IEEE TCSE)</p>
<p>Waikiki, Honolulu, USA
23-24 May 2011</p>
<p><a href="http://2011.seams-symposia.org/">http://2011.seams-symposia.org/</a></p>
<p><strong>THEME</strong></p>
<p>An increasingly important requirement for a software-based system is the ability to self-manage by adapting itself at run time to handle changing user needs, system intrusions or faults, a changing operational environment, and resource variability. Such a system must configure and reconfigure itself, augment its functionality, continually optimize itself, protect itself, and recover itself, while keeping its complexity hidden from the user.</p>
<p>The topic of self-adaptive and self-managing systems has been studied in a large number of specific areas, including software architectures, fault-tolerant computing, robotics, control systems, programming languages, and biologically-inspired computing.</p>
<p>The objective of this symposium is to bring together researchers and practitioners from many of these diverse areas to engage in stimulating dialogue regarding the fundamental principles, state of the art, and critical challenges of self-adaptive and self-managing systems. Specifically, we intend to focus on the software engineering aspects, including the methods, architectures, algorithms, techniques, and tools that can be used to support dynamic adaptive behavior that includes self-adaptive, self-managing, self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-configuring, and autonomic software.</p>
<p><strong>TOPICS OF INTEREST</strong></p>
<p>We are interested in submissions from both industry and academia on all topics related to this important area. These include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>formal notations for modeling and analyzing software self-adaptation</li>
    <li>programming language support for self-adaptation</li>
    <li>reuse support for self-adaptive systems (e.g., patterns, designs, code, etc.)</li>
    <li>design and architectural support for the self-adaptation of software</li>
    <li>algorithms for software self-adaptation</li>
    <li>integration mechanisms for self-adaptive systems</li>
    <li>evaluation and assurance for self-* systems (e.g., run-time verification)</li>
    <li>modeling and analysis of adaptive systems (e.g., run-time models, cost-benefit analysis, architectural styles and patterns, requirements)</li>
    <li>decision-making strategies for self-adaptive and self-organizing systems support for run-time monitoring (for requirements, design, performance, etc.)</li>
    <li>model problems and exemplars</li>
</ul>
The following application areas are of particular interest:
<ul>
<li> mobile computing</li>
    <li>dependable computing</li>
    <li>autonomous robotics</li>
    <li>adaptable user interfaces</li>
    <li>service-oriented systems</li>
    <li> autonomic computing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PAPER SUBMISSION DETAILS</strong></p>
<p>We are soliciting three types of papers: research papers and experience reports (up to 10 pages, ACM SIG Proceedings Format) and position papers for new ideas (up to 6 pages, ACM SIG Proceedings Format). Research papers should clearly describe the technical contribution and how the work has been validated. Experience reports should describe how an existing technique has been applied to real-world examples, including lessons learned from the experience. New idea papers provide an opportunity to describe novel and promising ideas and/or techniques that might not have been fully validated. All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere. The accepted papers will appear in the symposium proceedings that will be published as ACM conference proceedings.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT DATES</strong></p>
<p>Submission deadline: 12th December 2010</p>
<p>Author notification: 15th February 2011</p>

<div id="blog-description">1st IFIP/IEEE Workshop on Managing Federations and Cooperative Management</div>
<div id="manfed-location-header">Co-located with IM 2011 in Dublin, Ireland.</div>
<div id="manfed-date-header">May 23, 2011</div>
<p>Management approaches that can be applied across  organisational boundaries are increasingly important in a wide range of  application areas. These range from algorithmic approaches which adapt  to the observed behaviour of third-party systems, based on  game-theoretic approaches or other predictive models, to explicit  organisational federations which adopt coherent solutions and management  models to facilitate interoperability among multiple independent  organisations.</p>
<p>There are a number of significant, common, complex issues which must  be addressed in all technologies and applications that involve federated  organisations – how to enable secure governance in the absence of a  single, central point of authority; how to achieve semantic  interoperability in the absence of common schema; how to provide  effective access control in the absence of common user and role models;  how to provide analytics and support for effective decision making;  how  to adapt to environments that can be highly dynamic as well as highly  heterogeneous; how to construct and maintain a common inter-domain  governance model in the presence of highly diverse local governance  infrastructures .</p>
<p>This workshop will, for the first time, bring together researchers  from a broad array of application and technical areas who are concerned  with cross-domain management. It will draw out common themes, problems  and issues encountered, and the solutions being designed to deal with  the problems of managing information systems that span autonomous  domains. It will aim to provide the basis for a common understanding and  common approaches to inter-domain management and governance that  synthesises the insights and best of breed solutions being developed in  the diverse areas in which these problems are encountered.</p>
<h5>TOPICS TO BE ADDRESSED, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</h5>
<p>Cross Domain and Federated Management Issues in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governance mechanisms for federated environments, e.g. Policy Based Management</li>
    <li>Collaborative management, algorithmic adaptation, game theoretic approaches, predictive modeling.</li>
    <li>Modelling cross-domain relationships, i.e. Information models, formal specifications, languages for federation</li>
    <li>Distributed trust management and federated security systems</li>

<h3><strong>Call for panels</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>IM is one of the premier venues in network management, providing a forum for discussing a broad range of issues relating to network structure, services, optimisation, adaptation and management. This year's symposium has a special emphasis on effective and energy-efficient design, deployment and management of current and future networks and services.
We are seeking proposals for expert discussion panels to stimulate and inform the audience as to the current "hot topics" within network management. An ideal panel will bring the audience into a discussion prompted by position statements from the panel members, taking account of both academic and industrial viewpoints. We are interested in panels on all aspects of network management, especially those related to the theme of energy awareness and those discussing the wider aspects of networks and network management. This would include the following topics, amongst others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-transport and multi-media networks</li>
    <li>Network adaptation and optimisation</li>
    <li>Co-managing performance and energy</li>
    <li>The uses and abuses of sensor networks</li>
    <li>The science of service design and implementation</li>
    <li>Programming network management strategies</li>
    <li>Tools and techniques for network management</li>
    <li>Socio-technical integration of networks</li>
    <li>Energy-efficiency vs equality of access</li>
    <li>Network-aware cloud computing</li>
    <li>The future of autonomic management</li>
    <li>Coping with data obesity</li>
    <li>Managing the next-generation internet</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to propose a panel</strong></h3>
<p>Please send a brief (1-page) proposal to the panel chairs, <a href="mailto:sd@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk">Simon Dobson</a> and <a href="mailto:gp.parr@ulster.ac.uk">Gerard Parr</a>. Your proposal should indicate the  relevance of the panel to the broad audience of IM, and include the names of proposed panel members.</p>
<h3>Important dates</h3>

<p>I've spent this week at the <a href="http://www.pervasive2010.org">Pervasive 2010 conference</a> on pervasive computing, along with the <a href="http://www.pmmps.org">Programming Methods for Mobile and Pervasive Systems</a> workshop I co-arranged with <a href="http://www.dominicduggan.org/">Dominic Duggan</a>. Both events have been fascinating.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The PMMPS workshop is something we've wanted to run for a while, bringing together the programming language and pervasive/mobile communities to see where languages  ought to go. We received a diverse set of submissions: keynotes from Roy Campbell and Aaron Quigley, talks covering topics including debugging, software processes, temporal aspects (me), context collectionvisual programming ang a lot more. Some threads emerge quite strongly, but I think they'll have to wait for a later post after I've collected my thoughts a bit more.</p>
<p>The main conference included many  papers so good that it seems a shame to single any out. The following are simply those that spoke most strongly to me:</p>
<p><strong>Panorama and Cascadia.</strong> The University of Washington presented work on a "complex" events system, combining lower-level raw events. Simple sensor events are noisy and often limited in their coverage. Cascadiais an event service that allows complex events to be defined over the raw event stream, using Bayesian particle filters to interpolate missing events or those from uncovered areas: so it's possible in principle to inferentially  "sense" someone's location even in places without explicit sensor coverage, using a model of the space being observed. This is something that could be generalised to other model-based sensor streams. The Panorama tool allows end-users to specify complex events by manipulating thresholds, which seems little unsatisfactory: there's no principled way to determine the thresholds, and it still begs the question of how to program with the uncertain event stream. Still, I have to say this is the first complex event system I've seen that I actually believe could work.</p>
<p><strong>Eyecatcher.</strong> How do you stop people hiding from a camera, or playing-up to it? Work from Ochanomizu University in Japan places a small display on top of the camera, which can be used to present images to catch the subject's attention and to suggest poses or actions. (Another version barks like a dog, to attract your pet's attention.)I have to say this research is very Japanese, a very unusual but perceptive view of the world and the problems appropriate for research.</p>
<p><strong>Emotion modeling</strong>. Jennifer Healey from Intel described how to monitor and infer emotions from physiological data. The main problem is that there is no common language for describing emotions -- "anxious" is good for some and bad for others -- so getting ground truth is hard even given extensive logging.</p>
<p><strong>Indoor location tracking for non-experts</strong>. More University of Washington work, this time looking at an indoor location system simple enough to be used by non-experts such as rehabilitation therapists. They used powerline positioning, injecting different frequencies into a home's power network and detecting the radiated signal using what are essentially AM radios. Interestingly one of the most important factors was the aesthetics of the sensors: people don't want ugly boxes in their home.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer learning</strong>. Tim van Kasteren of the University of Amsterdam has generated one of the most useful smart-home data sets, used across the community (including by several of my students). He reported experiences with transfering machine-learned classifiers from one sensor network to another, by mapping the data into a new, synthetic feature space. He also used the known distribution of features from the first network to condition the learning algorithhm in the second, to improve convergence.</p>
<p><strong>Common Sense</strong>. Work from UC Berkeley on a platform for participative sensing: <a href="http://www.communitysensing.org/">CommonSense</a>. The idea is to place environmental sensors onto commodity mobile devices, and give them to street cleaners and others "out and about" in a community. The great thing about this is that is gives information on pollution and the like to the communities themselves, directly, rather than mediated through a (possibly indifferent or otherwise) State agency.</p>
<p><strong>Energy-aware data traffic management</strong>. I should add the disclaimer that is work by my colleague, Mirco Musolesi of the University of  St Andrews. Sensor nodes need to be careful about the energy they use to transmit data back to their base station. This work compares a range of strategies that trade-off the accuracy of returned data with the amount of traffic exchanged and so the impact on the nodoe's battery. This is //really// important for environmental sensing, and makes me think about further modifying the models to account for what's being sensed to trade-off information content as well.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials</strong> AJ Brush did a wonderful tutorial on how to do user surveys. This is something we've done ourselves, and it was great to see the issues nailed-down -- along with war stories of how to plan and conduct a survey for greatest validity and impact. Equally, John Krumm did a fantastic overview of signal processing, particle filters, hidden Markov models and the like that make the maths <em>far</em> more accessible than it normally is. Adrian Friday heroically took the graveyard slot with experiences and ideas about system support for pervasive systems.</p>
<p>This is the first large conference I've attended for a while, for various reasons, and it's been a great week both scientifically and socially. The organisers at the University of Helsinki deserve an enormous vote of thanks for their efforts. Pervasive next year will be in San Francisco, an I'll definitely be there -- hopefully with a paper to present :-)</p>

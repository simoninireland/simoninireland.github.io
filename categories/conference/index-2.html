<p>Papers are invited on topics in middleware, tools and services  for sensor and other embedded systems.</p>

<h2>Sixth International Workshop on Middleware Tools, Services and  Run-time Support for Networked Embedded Systems (<a href="http://www.midsens.org/index.html" target="_blank">MidSens’11</a>)</h2>
<h3>Co-located with <a href="http://2011.middleware-conference.org/">Middleware 2011</a> (December 12th - December 16th, 2011), Lisbon, Portugal</h3>
<p>The aim of MidSens’11 is to stimulate research in the  specific domain of middleware for networked embedded systems. This  year’s focus is on sensor networks and robotics control – a broader  focus than the previous editions – since we believe that the extended  scope will result in complementary and synergetic submissions from  researchers working in both niches. Along with the ‘core’ topic of  middleware architectures, services and tool support, MidSens’11 will  also seek quality papers describing novel programming languages,  run-time support and relevant experience reports. As with previous  editions of this workshop, MidSens’11 will investigate how middleware  support can relieve developers from low-level, platform specific  concerns, while enabling optimal exploitation of available resources. We  hope that you will be able to join us in Lisbon on December 12th 2011.</p>
<p>Middleware for networked embedded systems such as sensor networks and  robotics is a critical research domain which addresses key challenges  that application developers are facing today. The five previous editions  of this workshop (<a href="http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/conference/MidSens2006/">MidSens'06</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/conference/MidSens2007/">MidSens'07</a>, <a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/midsens08/">MidSens'08</a>, <a href="http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/events/midsens09/">MidSens'09</a> and <a href="http://www.midsens.org/2010/"> MidSens'10</a>)  attracted researchers from Europe, Asia, and the United States. The  MidSens workshop series has served to trigger and guide research efforts  to create an <em>integrated middleware vision</em>, which is required to  handle the challenges inherent in developing, deploying and managing  complex networked embedded applications in an efficient way.</p>
<p>The workshop seeks papers in, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Middleware Tools and Architectures:
<ul>
<li> Architectures for networked embedded systems.</li>
    <li> Novel programming abstractions.</li>
    <li> Lightweight agent middleware for embedded systems.</li>
    <li> Testing and simulation tools.</li>
    <li> Fault identification, diagnosis and repair.</li>

<h2>
<a href="http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/D3Science/" target="_blank">Workshop on D3Science</a> - Call for Papers</h2>
<div>
<h3>(To be held with <a href="http://www.escience2011.org/" target="_blank">IEEE e-Science 2011</a>)
Monday, 5 December 2011
Stockholm, Sweden</h3>
</div>
<div>

This workshop is interested in data-intensive, distributed, and dynamic (D3) science. It will also focus on innovative approaches for scalability in the end-to-end real-time processing of scientific data. We refer to D3 applications as those are data-intensive, are fundamentally, or need to be, distributed, and need to support and respond to data that may be non-persistent and is dynamically generated. We are also looking to bring researchers together to look at holistic, rather than piecewise, approaches to the end-to-end processing and managing of scientific data.

</div>
<div>

There has been a lot of effort in managing and distributing tasks where computation is dominant. Such applications have after all, been historically the drivers of "grid" computing. There has been, however, relatively less effort on tasks where the computationalload is matched by the data load, or even dominated by the data load. For such tasks to be able to operate at scale, there are conceptually simple run-time tradeoffs that need to be made, such as determining whether to move data to compute versus moving compute to data, or possibly regenerating data on-the-fly. Due to fluctuating resource availability and capabilities, as well as insufficient prior information about application requirements, such decisions must be made at run-time. Furthermore, resource, connectivity and/or storage constraints may require the data to be manipulated in-transit so that it is "made-right" for the consumer. Currently it is very difficult to implement these dynamic decisions or the underlying mechanisms in a general-purpose and scalable fashion. Although the increasing volumes and complexity of data will make many problems data-dominated, the computational requirements will still be high. In practice, data-intensive applications will encompass data-driven applications. For example, many data-driven applications will involve computational activities triggered as a consequence of independently created data; thus it is imperative for an application to be able to respond to unplanned changes in data load or content. Therefore, understanding how to support dynamic computations is a fundamental, but currently missing element in data-intensive computing.

</div>
<div>

The D3Science workshop builds upon a 3 year research theme on Distributed Programming Abstractions (DPA, <a href="http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/Distributed_Programming_Abstractions">http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/Distributed_Programming_Abstractions</a>), which has held a series of related workshops including but not limited to e-Science 2008, EuroPar 2008 and the CLADE series, and the ongoing 3DPAS (<a href="http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/3DPAS">http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/3DPAS</a>) research theme funded by the NSF and UK EPSRC, which is holding one workshop in June 2011: the 3DAPAS workshop (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/3dapas/">https://sites.google.com/site/3dapas/</a>). The workshop is intended to lead to a funding proposal for transcontinental collaboration, with contributors as potential members of the collaboration, and as such, we are particularly interested is discussing both existing and future projects that are suitable for transcontinental collaboration.

<h3>2nd International Workshop on Programming Methods for Mobile and Pervasive Systems (PMMPS)</h3>
<a href="http://www.pmmps.org/">http://www.pmmps.org</a>
<p>San Francisco, California, USA, June 12, 2011.
Co-located with <a href="http://www.pervsiveconference.org">PERVASIVE 2011</a></p>
<p lang="x-western"></p>

<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>
<p>Pervasive mobile computing is here, but how these devices and services should be programmed is still something of a mystery. Programming mobile and pervasive applications is more than than building client-server or peer-peer systems with mobility, and it is more than providing usable interfaces for mobile devices that may interact with the surrounding context. It includes aspects such as disconnected and low-attention working, spontaneous collaboration, evolving and uncertain security regimes, and integration into services and workflows hosted on the internet.  In the past, efforts have focused on the form of human-device interfaces that can be built using mobile and distributed computing tools, or on human computer interface design based on, for example, the limited screen resolution and real estate provided by a smartphone.</p>
<p>Much of the challenge in building pervasive systems is in bringing together users' expectations of their interactions with the system with the model of a physical and virtual environment with which users interact in the context of the pervasive application.</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in programming languages, software architecture and design, and pervasive systems to present and discuss results and approaches to the development of mobile and pervasive systems. The goal is to begin the process of developing the software design and development tools necessary for the next generation of services in dynamic environments, including mobile and pervasive computing, wireless sensor networks, and adaptive devices.</p>
<h4><strong>Submission</strong></h4>
<p>Potential workshop participants are asked to submit a paper on topics relevant to programming models for mobile and pervasive systems. We are primarily seeking short position papers (2–4 pages), although full papers that have not been published and are not under consideration elsewhere will also be considered (a maximum of 10 pages). Position papers that lay out some of the challenges to programming mobile and pervasive systems, including past failures, are welcome.  Papers longer than 10 pages may be automatically rejected by the chairs or the programme committee. From the submissions, the programme committee will strive to balance participation between academia and industry and across topics. Selected papers will appear on the workshop web site; PMMPS has no formal published proceedings. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for publication in an appropriate journal (under negotiation).</p>
<p>Submissions will be accepted through the workshop web site, <a href="http://www.pmmps.org/">http://www.pmmps.org</a></p>

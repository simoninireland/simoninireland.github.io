</a>@SASO2016Conf</p>
<p>Foundations and Applications of Self<em> Systems (FAS</em>) is the umbrella for two closely related but independent conferences, the International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO) and the International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC). The FAS<em> Doctoral Symposium provides an international forum for PhD Students working in research areas addressed by FAS</em>. In this forum, PhD students will get unique opportunities to subject their research to the scrutiny of external experts, gain experience in the presentation of research, connect to peers and experts addressing similar problems, and get advice from a panel of internationally leading researchers.</p>
<p>Different from the technical tracks of the conference, the FAS* Doctoral Symposium focuses on the specific needs of young researchers at the beginning of their career. As such, particular emphasis will be placed on a critical and constructive feedback that shall help participants to successfully conclude their PhD studies.</p>
<p>PhD students working in any area addressed by the FAS<em> conferences are invited to submit a Doctoral Symposium paper in which they describe the key motivation and objectives of their research project, and reflect on the methodology as well as the current status of their PhD studies. Complementing the thematic focus of FAS</em>, we particularly solicit contributions in the following areas:</p>
<p><em>Engineering of self-organizing and self-adaptive systems.</em> We solicit theoretical and applied works addressing fundamental principles underlying self-organizing systems, as well as methods that allow to quantify, model and reproduce the self-<em> characteristics of complex systems in biological, social, physical and technical systems. Examples include mechanisms underlying distributed decision- making and collective intelligence, software engineering challenges in self-adaptive systems, as well as general application of self-</em> principles in the engineering of technical systems.</p>
<p><em>Complex Cyber-physical and socio-technical systems.</em> We welcome contributions that apply self-* principles to address challenges in the design of complex cyber- physical and socio-technical systems. Particular examples include smart grid infrastructures, sensor networks, opportunistic networking scenarios, as well as large-scale social information systems. Works addressing challenges such as the security, privacy and anonymity of users, or mechanisms to prevent censorship, manipulation or unfairness in socio-technical systems are especially welcome. We further solicit works on socio- technical and socio-economic challenges in P2P systems, such as the design of incentive, trust and reputation mechanisms.</p>
<p><em>Self-<em> approaches in Massive-Scale Decentralized Systems.</em> Works in this area use self-</em> approaches to address challenges in the design and operation of massive scale decentralized systems. Examples include Peer-to-Peer technologies, as well as overlay topology management schemes. We are further interested in decentralized data mining and machine learning approaches, as well as decentralized approaches to monitor, model and adapt distributed systems. Works using self-* principles to address the inherent challenges in the design of massive-scale systems with unreliable and heterogeneous are of particular interest.</p>
<p><em>Autonomic Computing.</em> Systems Here we are interested in all works addressing the self-configuration, self-optimization and self-adaptation of cloud computing services, data centers and general distributed computing systems. Examples for questions addressed in this area include the monitoring and modeling of cloud services, the design of efficient resource allocation mechanisms, the application of data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the behavior of technical systems, as well as the characterization of distributed computing workloads.</p>
<p><em>Application of Self-<em> in Robotics and Spatial Computing.</em> Finally, we welcome contributions using self-</em> principles in the areas of robotics, swarm robotics and spatial computing. Here, examples for works of interest include environmental modeling and perception, machine vision, and self-adaptation mechanisms in robotics, distributed coordination and collective intelligence in multi- robot systems, as well as novel paradigms for the programming of autonomous, spatially distributed entities.</p>
<h4>Submission Instructions</h4>
<p>Submissions should have a length of max. six pages and be formatted according to the IEEE Computer Society Press proceedings style guide. Authors should submit their papers using the EasyChair installation of the main conference, which is available at:</p>

<h3>First International Workshop on Spatial and COllective PErvasive Computing Systems (SCOPES) Workshop</h3>
Co-located with IEEE SASO 2015, located at MIT, Cambridge, USA
<p>September 21, 2015</p>
<p><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.spatial-computing.org/scopes">http://www.spatial-computing.org/scopes</a></p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This workshop aims at combining three distinct, yet closely related areas of research, which will likely together play a major role in producing the key technical results needed to develop large-scale adaptive distributed systems of future networked scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spatial computing: Spatial computing systems are systems of individual entities, typically situated in a physical environment, in which the “functional goals” of the system are generally defined in terms of the system's spatial structure. Typically, such systems are developed following a self-organisation approach, making spatial patterns arise by emergence.</li>
    <li>Collective adaptive systems: Collective computing systems are systems of tightly entangled components, achieving an overall goal through widespread cooperation, typically relying on self-adaptation techniques and collective/social intelligence.</li>
    <li>Pervasive computing: Pervasive computing systems and the “Internet of Things” deal with current and emerging scenarios in which humans, sensors, mobile, and embedded devices engage in complex interactions in a shared environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to foster the creation of general-purpose solutions for supporting the development of these kinds of systems, particularly as regards generalizable techniques and architectures. Topics of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundational models of spatially embedded collective systems, exhibiting resilience, robustness and scalability properties as required by emerging pervasive computing scenarios.</li>
    <li>Tools and tool-chains targeting large-scale situated systems: programming or specification languages, compilers and proof-checking techniques, simulators, tools for property verification, libraries and APIs, supporting platforms, whole infrastructures.</li>
    <li>Innovative methods and techniques for system development, including design patterns, software methodologies, best practices, and practical experience reports.</li>
    <li>Applications contexts and scenarios of general interest to foster the identification of new problems and solutions, taking inspiration from cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things, sensor networks, smart-cities, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Paper submission</h4>
<p>Papers should present original work and be no longer than 6 pages in the standard IEEE two-column format. All manuscripts should be submitted in PDF form through the submissions system for SCOPES at EasyChair. Papers will be peer reviewed on the basis of originality, readability, relevance to themes, soundness, and overall quality. Workshop proceedings will be published on IEEE Xplore in parallel with the main conference proceedings. Post-proceedings publication in a journal is planned. Questions should be addressed to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:saso.scopes2015@easychair.org">saso.scopes2015@easychair.org</a>.</p>

<p>My colleagues in Newcastle (where I did my first degree) have an MRes/PhD position available in computational behaviour analysis.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Together with colleagues from Agriculture, the <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/" target="_blank">School of Computing Science in Newcastle</a> have recently been active in the field of computational behaviour analysis in livestock animals. They have a small grant on which we are currently doing some  pilot work related to food safety and animal wellbeing, which has now given rise to funding for an integrated MRes / PhD studentship to work in this field.</p>
<p>The group wants to work on a system for automatic tracking of farm pigs (indoor) and on modelling their behaviour (as individuals and in the group) with the goal of early detection of changes therein that might be linked to  certain diseases. The project involves some very strong partners from and connections to agriculture and access to farms and industry.  The topic is extremely relevant for the UK industry and has wider societal impact (food safety, animal welfare). They are looking for strong CS candidates with a background in machine learning, signal processing, or computer vision, and an interest in working in an multi-disciplinary team on a challenging and very interesting topic with substantial societal and economic relevance.</p>
<p>The funding covers four years of fees and maintenance. UK home  students (and EU citizens who have been residents for at least three years) are eligible for the full funding, EU students essentially for 50%. Throughout the first year the student will be enrolled into an MRes program with courses and time to get familiar with the topic, which is a fantastic opportunity for students to obtain an interdisciplinary skill-set.</p>

<p>I was interviewed at <a href="http://saso2012.univ-lyon1.fr/" target="_blank">SASO</a> as part of collecting what people thought were the ways forward and important topics for pervasive systems.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.aware-project.eu" target="_blank">Aware project</a> co-ordinates between a collection of EU projects into self-awareness and adaptive systems. As part of its remit it collects the evolving opinions of the research community to try to decide where the research is leading, and in particular what are the emerging questions that might be supported by future EU initiatives. Interviewing researchers is a new departure that I haven't seen before, and they <a href="http://www.aware-project.eu/category/research-agenda-2/video-opinions/" target="_blank">interviewed several people with diverse backgrounds</a> to get a broad sweep of the area.</p>
<p>I focused on how little we understand how to model what people actually do in the course of their lives, and consequently how hard it is to explain these processes to computers and build computer-mediated analysis and support.</p>
<p>(Sorry about the noise in the background, we were standing in a corridor....)</p>

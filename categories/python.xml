&lt;h2 id="orgb8af6ca"&gt;The different energy footprints of different programming languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb8af6ca"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've recently been thinking about low-power computing, from AI and
data centres down to sensors, as part of a new initiative the
University is considering. It's easy to forget the resource
footprint of our computing systems – especially those that are "out
of sight, out of mind" in the cloud – but there's growing evidence
that their growth threatens the renewable energy transition. Some of
the figures for AI electricity and water usage are astonishing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One aspect of this is the effect of choice of programming language.
I can across some work from 2017 on this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rui Pereira, Marco Couto, Francisco Ribeiro, Rui Rua, Cunha Jácome,
João Paulo Fernandes, and João Saraiva. &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3136014.3136031"&gt;Energy Efficiency across
Programming Languages: How Do Energy, Time, and Memory Relate?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; In
&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the 10th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on
Software Language Engineering&lt;/i&gt;. 2017.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The authors compare 13 benchmarks run in 27 different languages,
with the benchmarks being chosen widely to avoid being biased by
numeric performance. I was expecting some patterns: compiled
languages doing better on performance, memory, and energy usage, for
example. But I wasn't expecting exactly &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; widely the figures
diverged, or some of the details.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The following table is from the paper, annotated by me. The figures
are normalised against the best result in each category (so the top
language has value 1, and so on).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p width="80%" align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://simondobson.org/attachments/fb/debea0-0913-41c2-90bc-726153de8d28/pl-energy.png" alt="pl-energy.png"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The two most-used languages for web application, Python and
JavaScript, perform uniformly pretty badly: 75 times C's energy
usage, in Python's case. But although JavaScript does substantially
better on energy (only a factor of 4), TypeScript – which is
usually thought of as JavaScript with type pre-processing –
requires 21 times C's energy, or 5 times JavaScript's. Why is that?
– I can't think of a reason.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But the real surprise was that "research" languages like Haskell and
Lisp both hold up well: twice C's energy, in Lisp's case. I don't
think that would surprise modern Lisp programmers, who are used to
their compilers' efficiencies – but it would surprise someone used
only to the "hearsay" about Lisp. The same for Haskell, actually,
whose modern compilers really leverage the extra structure. When you
consider that both those languages are pretty much dependent on
garbage collection and so are doing substantially &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; work than the
equivalent C program, it's impressive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Also look in the table for Racket, consistently lower than Lisp
despite their close similarities. I suspect this is a compiler
optimisation issue more than anything else.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This work clearly isn't complete or definitive. Clojure is entirely
missing, as is Scala, and there will have been compiler improvements
since 2017 for the languages with the most active developer
communities. But it's still quite sobering that the differences are
&lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; wide, and that we've chosen to push languages that exacerbate
energy usage rather than managing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been thinking about running &lt;a href="https://jupyter.org"&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt; in the cloud for
some fairly compute-intensive simulation. Specifically I want to do
epidemic and other simulations over complex networks. These are
CPU-intensive and don't make use of GPU acceleration (yet, anyway).
Using the cloud would make things easier to scale-out, especially
for those without access to a local compute cluster.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/"&gt;Jinja2&lt;/a&gt; template engine defines a suite of &lt;a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#custom-filters"&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt; that can be
used to transform text as it's rendered. You can define extra custom
filters, and also make them available within &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; templates (as
long as the theme uses Jinja as its template engine, of course.)
&lt;/p&gt;

development, and noticed an unexpected convergence in the designs of
the two tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TASTER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been a long-time &lt;a href="https://emacs.org"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; user. I periodically
get a desire to try something new, something less old-school, just to
see whether there are advantages. There always &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; advantages, of
course -- but often significant disadvantages as well, which often
keep me coming back to my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most recent excursion was to try Microsoft's &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;VS
Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Microsoft VS Code" src="https://simondobson.org/images/posts/20210223-vscode.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is handily cross-platform, being built in Javascript on top of
&lt;a href="https://www.electronjs.org/"&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;. It's got a lot of nice
features: a tree view of the project in the left-hand pane, syntax
colouring, code style linting, integrated debugging and unit test
running, integrated connection to git, and so on. Looking a little
closer there are all sorts of status markers around the code and in
the ribbons at the bottom of panes and the window overall to show
status that might be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's so &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;. That's a feature of VS Code, not of Electron (as I
first suspected), because other Electron-based editors like
&lt;a href="https://atom.io/"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; aren't as slow. And my development box isn't
the latest, but it also isn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I reverted to Emacs, but upgraded it a little to more modern
standards. Specifically, I installed the
&lt;a href="https://elpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"&gt;elpy&lt;/a&gt; Python IDE,
with assorted other packages suggested by various sites. The result is
this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Emacs with elpy" src="https://simondobson.org/images/posts/20210223-emacs.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for anyone who's used Emacs for a while, it's definitely still
Emacs -- not least with the convoluted keystrokes and infinite
customisation you either love or hate. But it's striking how similar
the two IDEs now are, and striking how VS Code has inherited some
ideas from Emacs: resizeable panes, modelines in the ribbon, markers
in pane gutters, and so forth -- things that Emacs-based applications
have had for years, which have now migrated into "the mainstream".
Both the feature sets and the visuals of the two systems are very
similar indeed. Both are entirely cross-platform and extensible. For
VS Code you write extensions in Javascript; for Emacs you write them
in Lisp; and that's about it. And Emacs is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; faster on my
set-up. There are some limitations -- I've yet to get the hang of
using &lt;code&gt;pdb&lt;/code&gt; as a debugger, for example, especially for modules
and from within tests -- but the functionality is really quite comparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's safe to say there's been cross-fertilisation between VS
Code (and other IDEs) and Emacs over the years. A lot of the
developers of the former quite possibly used the latter. But I
strongly suspect that most of the traffic has gone &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; Emacs &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;
the other systems: the similarities are just too great to be
accidental. It's interesting to think that a system that emerged at
the dawn of the free-software movement has had -- and is still having
-- such an influence on modern development tools. And I'm happily back
in my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>emacs</category><category>python</category><category>software engineering</category><category>vs code</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/2021/02/23/ide-convergence/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 12:21:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Backporting Python type annotations</title><link>https://simondobson.org/2020/12/09/backporting-python-types/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently added type annotations to my

&lt;h2 id="orgdd2a433"&gt;TIL: Stroke order of Chinese surnames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdd2a433"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes we publish papers with authors in alphabetical order;
sometimes we use an order based on contribution, typically the main
author (often the most junior) first followed by the lesser
contributors and culminating in the most senior author, who might not
have made many concrete contributions to the writing. Personally I'm
a firm believer in the second style.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But I always wondered: how does one list authors in alphabetical
order for languages like Chinese that are non-alphabetic? I had the
opportunity to ask a couple of Chinese colleagues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While Chinese doesn't have an &lt;i&gt;alphabetical&lt;/i&gt; order, it can use a
&lt;i&gt;stroke&lt;/i&gt; order: some surnames require more strokes than others,
often significantly more (four &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; eleven, in the case of the
two colleagues who explained this to me). So one can list authors in
order of the increasing numbers of strokes needed to write their
surnames.  That's really clever, and no more or less arbitrary in
terms of author appearance than the alphabetic approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

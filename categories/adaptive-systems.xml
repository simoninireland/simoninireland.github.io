&lt;strong&gt;CALL FOR PAPERS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3rd Workshop on Engineering Collective Adaptive Systems – eCAS 2018
In conjunction with &lt;a href="http://fasstar.org/"&gt;FAS* 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2018
Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) &amp;amp; University of Trento - Trento, Italy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web site: &lt;a href="http://ecas2018.apice.unibo.it/"&gt;ecas2018.apice.unibo.it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIMS AND MOTIVATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern software systems are becoming more and more collective, composed of many distributed and heterogeneous entities. These systems operate under continuous perturbations making manual adjustments infeasible. For a collective system to be resilient, its adaptation must also be collective, in the sense that multiple entities must adapt in a way that addresses critical runtime conditions while preserving the benefits of the collaborative interdependencies. Decision-making in such systems is distributed and possibly highly dispersed, and interaction between the entities may lead to the emergence of unexpected phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such systems, a new approach for adaptation is needed to allow (i) multiple entities to collectively adapt with (ii) negotiations to decide which collective changes are best. Collective adaptation also raises a second important challenge: which parts of the system (things, services, people) should be engaged in an adaptation? This is not trivial, since multiple solutions to the same problem may be generated at different levels. The challenge here is to understand these levels and create mechanisms to decide the right scope for an adaptation for a given problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop solicits papers that address new methodologies, theories and principles that can be used in order to develop a better understanding of the fundamental factors underpinning the operation of such systems, so that we can better design, build, and analyze them, as well as case studies and applications showing such approaches in action. Interdisciplinary work is particularly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggested Topics (but not limited to):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Novel theories relating to operating principles of CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Novel design principles for building CAS systems&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Insights into the short and long-term adaptation of CAS systems&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Insights into emergent properties of CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Insights into general properties of large scale, distributed CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Decision-making approaches in CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Methodologies for studying, analyzing, and building CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Frameworks for analyzing or developing CAS case studies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Languages, platforms, APIs and other tools for CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Scenarios, case studies, and experience reports of CAS in different contexts (e.g., Smart Mobility, Smart Energy/Smart Grid, Smart Buildings, traffic management, emergency response, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop is expected to attract participants from many disciplines, including Autonomic Computing, Biology, Game Theory, Evolutionary Computing, Network Science, Self-Organizing Systems, Pervasive Computing, and to be of interest to anyone working with the domain of large-scale self-adaptive systems. In addition, the European Commission has funded seven scientific projects and a Coordination Action in this area, with projects starting at the beginning of 2013. Thus, the workshop provides a natural base for the projects to meet and share ideas, even if it is in no way limited to this audience, and is likely to have broad appeal to a wide range of researchers. Potential audience members might work in application areas relating to large-scale distributed systems, or may come from any of the many disciplines that can provide insights into the operation and design of such systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COLLECTIVE ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS&lt;/h2&gt;
Special Track of the 32nd ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC'17)

April 3 - 7, 2017 Marrakech, Morocco
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, most aspects of our daily life are affected by pervasive technology, consisting of massive numbers of heterogeneous units/nodes (computers, devices, software applications, smart objects, etc.), complex interactions, and humans-in-the-loop. The distributed and open nature of these systems and their large scale make sensing, decision-making, planning and acting possibly highly dispersed: this may cause on the one hand the emergence of unexpected phenomena, but on the other hand it can be the key to support inherent adaptation and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complex systems are typically referred to as Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS). They have to be equipped with dynamic and autonomous adaptation capabilities, to deal with changes in their working environments and within themselves. CAS involve huge collections of cooperating components, trading off individual tasks, properties, objectives and actions, with overall system goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To properly engineer and exploit CAS, a deep scientific understanding of the principles underpinning their operation is required. The development of CAS is closely related to other contemporary (software) engineering approaches, such as component-based systems and middleware platforms, as well as other Computer Science areas, such as Distributed Artificial Intelligence, Formal Methods, Agent-based Programming, Pervasive Computing, Internet of Things, and Autonomic Computing. This track aims at providing a common forum for discussing the various different viewpoints over CAS, attracting relevant and consistent contributions from different research communities, with the ultimate goal of filling the gap between theory and practice, hence paving the way towards implementation of relevant applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Special Track on Collective Adaptive Systems takes deliberately a broad view of what CAS are and how they should be designed, analysed, built and deployed. In particular, the track's interest is both in the foundational view (e.g., theories, methods, formalisms, models) and the practical aspects (e.g., development methodologies, programming languages, middleware, development and runtime environments, tools). Moreover, also applications of CAS solutions to real-world case studies are welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major topics of interest this year will include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Novel models, languages, programming and implementation techniques for CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;CAS technologies and infrastructures&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;CAS applications&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Scenarios, case studies and experience reports of CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Formal aspects (semantics, reasoning, verification) in CAS development&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Business Processes in CAS - Self-* and emerging properties of CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Security and privacy in CAS - Policy-based coordination and self-adaptation in CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Middleware platforms for CAS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Software architectures and engineering methodologies for CAS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Proceedings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers accepted for the Special Track on Collective Adaptive Systems will be published by ACM both in the SAC 2017 proceedings and in the Digital Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAS Special Track organisers also plan to invite authors of selected papers for a Special Issue in a high impact journal, such as ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems or Science of Computer Programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paper submission and format&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All papers should represent original and previously unpublished works that currently are not under review in any conference or journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must NOT appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should be in the third person. This is to facilitate blind review. Only the title should be shown at the first page without the authors' information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submitted papers must be in the ACM two-column page format (doc template, pdf template, latex template). The length of the papers is 6 pages (included in the registration) plus up to 2 extra pages (at extra charge), i.e. total 8 pages maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper: This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submission is entirely automated via the STAR Submission System, which is available from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(for regular papers) &lt;a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.softconf.com/h/sac2017/"&gt;https://www.softconf.com/h/sac2017/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(for SRC papers) &lt;a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.softconf.com/h/sac-src2017/"&gt;https://www.softconf.com/h/sac-src2017/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Poster Sessions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers that received high reviews (that is acceptable by reviewer standards) but were not accepted due to space limitation can be invited for the poster session. Poster should be not longer than 3 pages (included in the registration) plus 1 extra page (at extra charge), i.e. total 4 pages maximum. The poster session procedures and details will be posted on SAC 2017 website as soon as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Student research abstracts competition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate students are invited to submit Student Research Competition (SRC) abstracts (maximum of 2 pages in ACM camera-ready format) following the instructions published at SAC 2017 website. Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers and practitioners with expertise in the track focus area to which they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts (up to 20 students) will have the opportunity to give poster and oral presentations of their work and compete for three top-winning places. The winners will receive medals, cash awards, and SIGAPP recognition certificates during the conference banquet. Invited students receive SRC travel support (US$500) and are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel Award Program (STAP) for additional travel support.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>adaptive systems</category><category>Blog</category><category>cfp</category><category>conference</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/blog/2016/07/18/cfp-cas/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 09:07:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Distinguished lecture on artificial life</title><link>https://simondobson.org/blog/2012/08/14/artificial-life/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our most recent distinguished lecture was the best I've heard so far, and on a fascinating topic I'd like to know more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We run two distinguished lectures each academic year, inviting an academic in to teach a four-hour course on some topic that often we don't really have expertise with in St Andrews. It exposes undergraduates, grad students and staff to new topics and ways of thinking about research. &lt;a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/distinguished-lectures/archive" target="_blank"&gt;The series goes back to 1969&lt;/a&gt; and includes some of the best-known names in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last semester's speaker was Larry Yaeger from the University of Indiana (on sabbatical at the University of Hertfordshire), who talked about artificial life: using computers to study the processes of evolution, speciation and adaptation. It's a topic that sits on the boundary between novel computing and theoretical biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/simondobson/files/2012/03/2012-03-12-11.38.021-e1335726535605.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-1127 alignnone" title="Larry in full flow" src="http://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/simondobson/files/2012/03/2012-03-12-11.38.021-e1335726535605-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial life sounds too much like science fiction to be "real" computer science: do we understand enough about life to be able to study it in the abstract?, and, if not, can artificial life have any scientific content. If you confine yourself enough, of course, then the answer to both questions is a qualified "yes", but the question then becomes, does it tell you anything meaningful about anything? Larry's talk showed that even quite abstracted artificial life scenarios still give some high-level information about the potential for systems design, especially for very dynamic adaptive systems in changing environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry's work has focused on building multi-agent simulations of processes, seeing how simple rule sets can give rise to complex behaviours. This has culminated in a system called &lt;a href="http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/Polyworld.html" target="_blank"&gt;Polyworld&lt;/a&gt;, that lets users set up "genetically" based  behaviours for agents. (There are some very cool &lt;a href="http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/PolyworldMovies.html" target="_blank"&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt; of it all working.) The genetic basis -- completely synthetic and higher-level that real genetics -- means that agents can evolve through mutation and cross-over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part I found most interesting was the way that these systems -- like the natural systems they're abstractions of -- tend not to do optimisation &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. Instead they find, and stick with, solutions that are "good enough". You get to a balance between evolutionary pressure not being strong enough, and the benefits not being great enough, for further changes to take place. The difference with traditional engineering is quite profound, both in this satisfaction with the sub-optimal but also in the fact that the selection is dynamic, so if the chosen approach ceases to be "good enough" as the environmental pressures change it will shift to another process as a matter of course. You get this dynamism all over chemistry, too, where chemical equilibrium remains a dynamic process with lots of reactions going on all the time without changing the macroscopic concentrations of the reagents involved. It's easy to mistake this for a static system, which it most definitely isn't: I think this is a mistake a lot of scientists and engineers make, though, and it's something we probably need to address when designing adaptive systems or sensor networks that need to operate against or within a complex environment. To do this we'd need to give up a lot of intuitions we have about design, and the possibility of a single "correct" solution to a problem, and think instead of a design space in which the system is (to some extent) free to explore -- and make this design space, and the exploration of it, concepts that are propagated to run-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this kind of approach makes sense even if you don't embrace the genetic algorithms style view of the world (which in the main I don't). In some ways this is a measure of the success of artificial life research: it's illuminating concepts that are of general utility outside the context from which they're being drawn, that can be used to influence other approaches to systems design without our having to junk everything we already know, which we're clearly not going to do. These sorts of incremental changes are far more useful than revolutions, in many ways, but they come about from thinking that's more-or-less divorced from mainstream thinking. It's a good illustration of why blue-skies research is important, and that knowledge really is all one piece with interconnections and interactions that we can't predict.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>adaptive systems</category><category>artificial intelligence</category><category>Blog</category><category>lecture</category><category>st andrews</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/blog/2012/08/14/artificial-life/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2012 07:00:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Funded PhD studentship in adaptive service ecosystems</title><link>https://simondobson.org/blog/2010/09/09/sapere-phd/</link><dc:creator>Simon Dobson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have an opening for someone interested in doing a PhD in adaptive services.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of St Andrews
School of Computer Science
&lt;a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk"&gt;http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funded PhD studentship in adaptive service ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an opening for a talented and well-motivated individual to investigate mechanisms for the design and implementation of long-lived, responsive and adaptive ecosystems of distributed services. This work will take place in the context of the &lt;a href="http://www.sapere-project.eu/"&gt;SAPERE project&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the EU Seventh Framework  Programme. SAPERE seeks to develop both the theory and practice of "self-aware" component technology, able to orchestrate and adapt to changing requirements, constraints, conditions and technologies. The University of St Andrews is leading the strand of research into describing and identifying opportunities for adaptation, building on past work in sensor fusion and situation identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful applicant will work closely with the other St Andrews staff (Prof Simon Dobson and Dr Juan Ye), as well as with the other SAPERE consortium partners. An interest in one or more of the fields of adaptive systems, pervasive computing, sensor-driven systems, uncertain reasoning and software engineering would be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studentship is funded for three years, including a stipend and all tuition fees. Please note that the conditions of funding restrict this opportunity to applicants who are nationals of an EU/EEA country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of St Andrews is the oldest university in Scotland (founded around 1410) and the third-oldest in the English-speaking world. Situated in a small town on the east coast of Scotland, it has a student population of around 8000 and an active research programme in a wide range of disciplines across the sciences and humanities. It has been consistently ranked in the top-10 universities in the UK by a number of recent league table exercises, and has been described by the Sunday Times as "now firmly established as the leading multi-faculty alternative to Oxford and Cambridge."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The School of Computer Science had 60% of its staff rated at 4&lt;em&gt; ("world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour," the highest available) or 3&lt;/em&gt; in the most recent UK Research Assessment Exercise. The School's academic staffing consists of 22 academics and over 25 post-doctoral fellows. There are also around 150 undergraduate full-time equivalent students and 30 PhD students. To stimulate a dynamic high-quality research environment, the School's research strategy concentrates on three research groups, each incorporating a number of key research topics pursued independently and in collaboration. The three research groups work in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation, Networks and Distributed Systems, and Systems  Engineering. Each group attracts a large amount of external funding from both the traditional research grant agencies (EPSRC, EU, etc.) and from  companies such as SUN Microsystems, ICL, Data Connection, Microsoft and BAe. The School is also a leading member of &lt;a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk"&gt;SICSA&lt;/a&gt;, a research alliance of leading computer science Schools across Scotland, with members of the School leading a number of core strategic activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the School, the Networks and Distributed Systems group is a world-class research centre, not only for software artefacts such as programming languages, object stores and operating systems but also in adaptive, pervasive and autonomic systems engineering and in the composition technologies used in such large-scale distributed systems such as peer-to-peer overlay mechanisms, distributed mediation, distributed termination and distributed garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply, please send a CV and statement of research interests by email to Prof Simon Dobson (&lt;a href="mailto:sd@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk"&gt;sd@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;), to whom informal inquiries can also be directed. The closing date for applications is 11 October 2010.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>adaptive systems</category><category>Blog</category><category>jobs</category><guid>https://simondobson.org/blog/2010/09/09/sapere-phd/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2010 14:09:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

modelling&lt;/a&gt; I didn't really have a
clear idea what I intended. Was it supposed to be a tutorial? Popular
science? Hardcore technical science? Was it even supposed to be for
public consumption at all? And regardless of the answer to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;
question, how do you write, format, and publish a book when you don't
want to put yourself under stress by engaging with a publisher?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just under three months I now know the answers to these
questions. It was a popular science tutorial complete with code. It
&lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; intended for public consumption, online and in print. And the
technology is accessible and rewarding for the dedicated hacker
(although possibly an indescribable frustration to anyone else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I should record the journey in case anyone else decides they
want to follow me on it.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2>Funded PhD Research Studentships</h2>
<h4>
<strong>University of St Andrews</strong> - School of Computer Science</h4>
<div id="job-advert-text">

The School of Computer Science at the University of St  Andrews has funding for students to undertake PhD research in any of  the general research areas in the school:

<a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research">http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research</a>

We are looking for highly motivated research students with an  interest in these exciting research areas. Our only requirements are  that the proposed research would be good, we have staff to supervise it,  and that you would be good at doing it. We have up to 6 funded  studentships available for students interested in working towards a PhD.  The studentships offers costs of fees and an annual tax-free  maintenance stipend of about £13,590 per year for 3.5 years.  Exceptionally well qualified and able students may be awarded an  enhanced stipend of an additional £2,000 per year. Students should  normally have or expect at least an upper-2nd class Honours degree or  Masters degree in Computer Science or a related discipline.

For further information on how to apply, see our postgraduate web pages (<a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/prospective-pg"><strong>http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/prospective-pg</strong></a>). The closing date for applications is <strong>March 1<sup>st</sup> 2012</strong> and we will make decisions on studentship allocation by <strong>May 1<sup>st</sup> 2012</strong>. (Applications after <strong>March 1st</strong> may be considered, at our discretion.) Informal enquiries can be directed to <a href="mailto:pg-enquiries@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk"><strong>pg-admin-cs@st-andrews.ac.uk</strong></a> or to potential supervisors.

<p>We have a three-year postdoc available immediately to work on programming languages and platforms for sensor networks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p></p>
<h3>Research Fellow – CD1060</h3>
School of Computer Science,  £32,751 - £35,788 per annum. Start: As soon as possible, Fixed Term 3 years
<p>We seek a  Research Fellow to design and implement an integrated software platform  based on mission specifications and evolution operators. The work will  be evaluated based on case study deployments in the context of  real-world large-scale WSANs.  You will specifically focus on generative programming techniques to  integrate the overall design, and will work with Professors Dearle and  Dobson.</p>
<p>The project involves re-architecting WSAN systems so that system-wide  behaviour is defined using explicit mission specifications. These allow  top-level constraints and trade-offs to be captured directly and used to  inform software deployment and evolution in a well-founded manner. We  compile mission-level components to collections of node-level components  connected using network overlays. We maintain both mission constraints  and management interfaces through to run-time where they can be  manipulated by evolution and recomposition operators.</p>
<p>You should have a good honours degree in Computer Science or a related  discipline, and preferably have, or be about to obtain, a PhD in  Computer Science. You will have strong software  development/OS/programming language skills. Experience in generative  programming, compilers, operating systems, component deployment and/or  sensor networks would be advantageous.  You should be a highly motivated  individual and be able to lead the day-to-day work.</p>
<p>This is a fixed-term post for 3 years, starting as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We have an opening for someone interested in doing a PhD in adaptive services.<!--more--></p>
<p>University of St Andrews
School of Computer Science

<p><strong>Funded PhD studentship in adaptive service ecosystems</strong></p>
<p><strong>The opportunity</strong></p>
<p>We have an opening for a talented and well-motivated individual to investigate mechanisms for the design and implementation of long-lived, responsive and adaptive ecosystems of distributed services. This work will take place in the context of the <a href="http://www.sapere-project.eu/">SAPERE project</a>, funded by the EU Seventh Framework  Programme. SAPERE seeks to develop both the theory and practice of "self-aware" component technology, able to orchestrate and adapt to changing requirements, constraints, conditions and technologies. The University of St Andrews is leading the strand of research into describing and identifying opportunities for adaptation, building on past work in sensor fusion and situation identification.</p>
<p>The successful applicant will work closely with the other St Andrews staff (Prof Simon Dobson and Dr Juan Ye), as well as with the other SAPERE consortium partners. An interest in one or more of the fields of adaptive systems, pervasive computing, sensor-driven systems, uncertain reasoning and software engineering would be desirable.</p>
<p>The studentship is funded for three years, including a stipend and all tuition fees. Please note that the conditions of funding restrict this opportunity to applicants who are nationals of an EU/EEA country.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The University of St Andrews is the oldest university in Scotland (founded around 1410) and the third-oldest in the English-speaking world. Situated in a small town on the east coast of Scotland, it has a student population of around 8000 and an active research programme in a wide range of disciplines across the sciences and humanities. It has been consistently ranked in the top-10 universities in the UK by a number of recent league table exercises, and has been described by the Sunday Times as "now firmly established as the leading multi-faculty alternative to Oxford and Cambridge."</p>
<p>The School of Computer Science had 60% of its staff rated at 4<em> ("world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour," the highest available) or 3</em> in the most recent UK Research Assessment Exercise. The School's academic staffing consists of 22 academics and over 25 post-doctoral fellows. There are also around 150 undergraduate full-time equivalent students and 30 PhD students. To stimulate a dynamic high-quality research environment, the School's research strategy concentrates on three research groups, each incorporating a number of key research topics pursued independently and in collaboration. The three research groups work in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation, Networks and Distributed Systems, and Systems  Engineering. Each group attracts a large amount of external funding from both the traditional research grant agencies (EPSRC, EU, etc.) and from  companies such as SUN Microsystems, ICL, Data Connection, Microsoft and BAe. The School is also a leading member of <a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk">SICSA</a>, a research alliance of leading computer science Schools across Scotland, with members of the School leading a number of core strategic activities.</p>
<p>Within the School, the Networks and Distributed Systems group is a world-class research centre, not only for software artefacts such as programming languages, object stores and operating systems but also in adaptive, pervasive and autonomic systems engineering and in the composition technologies used in such large-scale distributed systems such as peer-to-peer overlay mechanisms, distributed mediation, distributed termination and distributed garbage collection.</p>
<p><strong>Application</strong></p>
<p>To apply, please send a CV and statement of research interests by email to Prof Simon Dobson (<a href="mailto:sd@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk">sd@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk</a>), to whom informal inquiries can also be directed. The closing date for applications is 11 October 2010.</p>

<p>As part of the Science of Sensor Systems Software programme we have a 3-year postdoc post available.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/S4">S4 programme</a> aims to develop a unifying science, across the breadth of mathematics, computer science and engineering, that will let developers engineer for the uncertainty and ensure that their systems and the information they provide is resilient, responsive, reliable, statistically sound and robust. The vision is smarter sensor based systems in which scientists and policy makers can ask deeper questions and be confident in obtaining reliable answers, so the programme will deliver new principles and techniques for the development and deployment of verifiable, reliable, autonomous sensor systems that operate in uncertain, multiple and multi-scale environments.</p>
<p>S4 is funded by EPSRC as a five-year, £5.2M Programme Grant. It brings together four of the UK’s leading research teams in sensor systems, their design, analysis, deployment, and evaluation. Led overall by Prof Muffy Calder at the University of Glasgow, the other academic collaborators are the University of St Andrews (Prof Simon Dobson), the University of Liverpool (Prof Michael Fisher), and Imperial College (Prof Julie McCann). S4 also includes a portfolio of industrial partners ranging from start-up SMEs to multinational companies and State agencies.</p>
<p>St Andrews leads the work on adaptive systems engineering, especially on how systems need to change as time progresses, the system components fail, and goals change. We are looking for someone to join us to work on how to program adaptive sensor systems. A strong track record in sensor systems, programming languages, data analytics, or another related area is essential, as is an ability to work within a larger team using formal methods, advanced statistics, and novel programming languages and approaches</p>
<p>You can find full application details <a href="https://www.vacancies.st-andrews.ac.uk/ViewVacancyV2.aspx?enc=mEgrBL4XQK0+ld8aNkwYmIC6qnEzeM4xd5XT+e/5IQxO+OlhRndjgKS6p4BoRNl+UNu83Iiv8J1lWOCFqijDqZx6/oDoGWuUe3/xaL5So5YSmMSr2o2hu+3HhHpd8mWDap8m2c0rxOmXWk95vI/KJw==">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Research Fellowships in Autonomic Service-Oriented Computing for Smart Cities</strong></p>
<p>Applications are invited for two Postdoctoral Research Fellowships at <a href="http://www.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/" target="_blank">Trinity College Dublin’s Distributed Systems Group</a> to investigate the provision of a new service-oriented computing infrastructure that provides demand-based composition of software services interacting with a city-wide, dynamic network infrastructure. The project will investigate autonomic adaptation of services and infrastructure, ensuring resilient service provision within an integrated, city-wide system.</p>
<p>Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a closely-related discipline and strong C++/C#/Java development skills. Experience with autonomic computing, service-oriented middleware, and/or smart city technologies is desirable as are strong mathematical skills.</p>
<p>The project is supported by Science Foundation Ireland under the Principal Investigator programme between 2014-2018 and will be conducted in collaboration with Cork Institute of Technology, NUI Maynooth, IBM Smarter Cities Research Centre, Intel Intelligent Cities Lab, EMC2 Research Europe, and Arup.  The position is tenable from September 2014.</p>
<p>Please apply by email to <a href="mailto:Siobhan.Clarke@scss.tcd.ie">Siobhan.Clarke@scss.tcd.ie</a> quoting “Smart Cities Fellowship” in the subject line. Applications should include a curriculum vitae, in PDF format, giving full details of qualifications and experience, together with the names of two referees. The closing date for applications is the 20th June, 2014.</p>
<p>Trinity College is an equal opportunities employer.</p>

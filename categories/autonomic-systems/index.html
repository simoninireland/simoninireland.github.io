<p>Workshops now open for the  FAS* (ICCAC and SASO) conferences in Arizona in September</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The FAS<em> 2017 Steering Committee invites proposals for the Workshop Program to be held along with the technical conferences SASO 2017 and ICCAC 2017. FAS</em>W workshops will provide a meeting for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly  ore focused way than the conferences themselves. Their aim is to stimulate and facilitate active exchange, interaction, and comparison of approaches, methods, and ideas related to specific topics, both theoretical and applied, in the general area of Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems as well as Cloud and Autonomic Computing. To motivate the discussion and participation of all the workshop attendants, we encourage organizers to get away of the typical "mini-conference" format of a workshop, and include more discussion sessions, panels, etc. Members from all areas of the SASO and ICCAC communities are invited to submit workshop proposals for review. Workshops on global challenges, applications or on new and emerging topics are particularly encouraged. Workshops can vary in length, but most will be one full day in duration. Optionally, if desired by the organizers, workshop proceedings can be published through IEEE. Attendance of workshops will be included in the registration fee for the main SASO/ICCAC conference.
</p>

    <li>the quality of the proposal,</li>
    <li>complementarity with the conference topics,</li>
    <li>balance and distinctness of workshop topics, and</li>
    <li>the capacity of the conference workshop program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that authors of proposals addressing similar and/or overlapping content areas and/or audiences may be requested to merge their proposals.</p>
<h3>Responsibilities of FAS* 2017 Workshop Chairs</h3>
<p>For all accepted proposals, FAS* 2017 will be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing publicity for the workshop series as a whole. - Providing logistical support and a meeting place for the workshops.</li>

<h3>EAI Transactions on Self-Adaptive Systems</h3>
<a href="http://eai.eu/transaction/self-adaptive-systems" target="_blank">http://eai.eu/transaction/self-adaptive-systems</a>
<p>Editor-in-Chief: <a href="mailto:emil@vassev.com">Dr. Emil Vassev</a>, <a href="http://www.lero.ie" target="_blank">Lero, the Irish Software Engineering Centre</a>, University of Limerick, Ireland</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>This journal seeks contributions from leading experts from research and practice of self-adaptive systems that will provide the connection between theory and practice with the ultimate goal to bring both the science and industry closer to the so-called "autonomic culture" and successful realization of self-adaptive systems. Both theoretical and applied contributions related to the relevance and potential of engineering methods, approaches and tools for self-adaptive systems are particularly welcome. This applies to application areas and technologies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>adaptable user interfaces</li>
    <li>adaptable security and privacy</li>
    <li>autonomic computing</li>
    <li>dependable computing</li>
    <li>embedded systems</li>
    <li>genetic algorithms</li>
    <li>knowledge representation and reasoning</li>
    <li>machine learning</li>
    <li>mobile <em>ad hoc</em> networks</li>
    <li>mobile and autonomous robots</li>
    <li>multi-agent systems</li>
    <li>peer-to-peer applications</li>
    <li>sensor networks</li>
    <li>service-oriented architectures</li>
    <li>ubiquitous computing</li>
</ul>
<p>It also hold for many research fields, which have already investigated some aspects of self-adaptation from their own perspective, such as
fault-tolerant computing, distributed systems, biologically inspired computing, distributed artificial intelligence, integrated management, robotics, knowledge-based systems, machine learning, control theory, etc.</p>

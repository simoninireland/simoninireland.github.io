      <span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Justice is not the Law; it is not Order, as human beings normally speak of it; it is Justice &#8212; Equilibrium, the Correction of the Balance.&#8221;<br><br>This is one of the classic &#8220;swords and sorcery&#8221; series, a model for many that followed. Full of irony and wonderfully drawn scenes that a reader can visualise despite their fundamental and well-crafted alien-ness. I first read this work over twenty years ago, and my older self still loves it. <br><br>The story follows the adventures of Dorian Hawkmoon and companions as they fight the Dark Empire of Granbretan (nice touch, that) in a far post-apocalypic future. And defeat it, of course, though not before most of them die: this is fantasy fiction, after all. The plot is quite simple, in the sense that final victory is never seriously in question and momentary difficulties are quickly overcome. But that&#8217;s to quibble, and to ignore Moorcock&#8217;s skill as a fantasy writer, his ability to create a world that&#8217;s fundamentally still human despite its strange features and magical&nbsp;powers.

      </h2>

    <p>
      An exploration of end-of-life care – something that&#8217;s of interest to us all, of course, but very seldom addressed properly. And that&#8217;s Gawande&#8217;s essential point: people leave decisions about their last days <i>until</i> their last days, and so have a far worse time of it than perhaps they need to.<br><br>There&#8217;s much more to this book that this, though. Gawande explores the different approaches to assisted living and hospice care, the ways in which focusing on social rather than medical aspects can lead to far better outcomes, and shares his own family&#8217;s experiences with the difficulties that gradual illness can bring. (This is perhaps the greatest contribution of the book, and shows an enormous openness of spirit to share something so personal.) He demolishes the utopian visions of multi-generational living that sometimes cloud the debate, showing that this brings its own tensions: different to those of our more individualistic society, but certainly no less divisive. If nothing else, he shows that there <i>is</i> an alternative to medicalising old age, and that this is something we should all work towards in our own&nbsp;self-interest.

<h4>Research&nbsp;Topic</h4>
Increasingly in data-driven enterprises, organisations are having to cope with a wide variety of information sources and standards, leading to a lack of interoperability and increasing data integration costs. Resulting labour-intensive data integration practices are brittle in the face of accelerating innovation in data-driven applications and growing demand for agile data analytics. At the same time organisations must react to increasing public and legislative focus on privacy and data protection. Empowering users to control the information that flows around them in a privacy-sensitive and personalised manner also offers many challenges.

These 5 PhD positions will advance the state of the art in linked data, semantic web and personalisation technologies to explore new approaches to data integration that are self-managing (towards autonomic), and in addition explore new ways to deliver personalised multimodal information (towards a digital companion).

These posts are part of the new <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> Centre (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.adaptcentre.ie">http://www.adaptcentre.ie</a>). <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> has received €50 Million research funding from Industry and Science Foundation Ireland to support 120 researchers across 4 universities in Dublin. The <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> Centre’s mission is to produce world class research that delivers disruptive innovations for the digital media and intelligent content industry. These PhD positions will be supervised by a member of the following <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> Centre academics; Professor Vincent Wade, Professor Declan O’Sullivan, Professor Dave Lewis, Professor Owen Conlan and Dr Rob Brennan.

	Margaret MacMillan&nbsp;(2013)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A fine and detailed history of the period.<br><br>The First World War remains an enigma: how did the sustained period of peace that preceded it suddenly end so catastrophically? How did a relatively small triggering event become so magnified so quickly?<br><br>MacMillan explores the background of the politics and personalities with great care and thoroughness. She highlights several factors that are under-stressed in other histories, notably the broader impact of the Anglo-German naval race (by spoiling otheriwse improving relations between the countries) and the damaging impact of the Dreyfus Affair on the French army (by making a military career less attractive to ambitious individuals). She provides much deeper explorations of several events that are often mentioned only in passing, for example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeciras_Conference" rel="nofollow noopener">Algeciras conference</a>. She also spends great care on the different views of the same events as seen from opposite sides, and on the way that actions that one side saw as purely defensive appeared anything but from the standpoint of other countries.<br><br>But what really stands out is the fatalistic acceptance that many Europeans – both leaders and ordinary people – had for the concept of an impending war. That seems at odds with the prevailing peacefulness between the Great Powers, and certainly seems strange from a standpoint of modern public opinion: how could people accept the end of peace so easily, especially for a conflict that would be fought close to home for almost all of them? While it&#8217;s possible to argue that people hadn&#8217;t appreciated the impact that machine guns and barbed wire had on military dynamics (despite the evidence of American Civil War), that seems too technical an explanation for such a concerted act of folly.<br><br>One stylistic touch that I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> like is the rather trite use of modern analogies. Comparing German statesmen appearing in military uniform with the behaviours of modern dictators doesn&#8217;t seem to me to add much to the text, or to the understanding of the motivations involved. But that&#8217;s a minor quibble about what is certainly a fine discussion of events that still fascinate more than a century&nbsp;later.

	Richard Hytner&nbsp;(2014)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A book on how to shine from the shadows.<br><br>While most books on leadership concentrate on the leaders, and especially on how to become a more charismatic leader, this book takes the opposite tack: how to be a loyal supporter and an &#8220;invisible&#8221; leader even if you never take the top spot. As a dedicated introvert and fan of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12056826.Machiavelli__Niccolo" title="Machiavelli, Niccolo" rel="nofollow noopener">Niccolo Machiavelli</a>, this is definitely a position I can understand.<br><br>Hytner divides leaders into A&#8217;s and C&#8217;s, where A&#8217;s seek the limelight and C&#8217;s seek to wield their influence more discreetly. He sprinkles his presentation with some great examples of modern-day partnerships and how they work. He explores the different supporting roles needed in organisations, and the things that the headline leader needs – both positive in the sense of providing advice and research, and negative in the sense of reining-in and keeping grounded – that can best be provided by someone comfortable in their anonymity. In that sense this is a book both for those wanting to be better C&#8217;s, and for those A&#8217;s who want to choose their <i>consiglieri</i> wisely.<br><br>One observation that I wasn&#8217;t expecting was the idea of moving between the A and C role, that a C might aspire to move into the A position after a period of consolidation, or that an A might benefit from time spent out of the limelight as a C. Both these strike me as problematic for reasons of basic personality structure, but in any event they point to essential value of both the top jobs <i>and</i> their close supporters, and the need to manage both equally in a well-functioning organisation. <br><br></p>

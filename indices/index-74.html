			<p>Workshops now open for the  FAS* (ICCAC and SASO) conferences in Arizona in September

<!--more-->

The FAS* 2017 Steering Committee invites proposals for the Workshop Program to be held along with the technical conferences SASO 2017 and ICCAC 2017. FAS*W workshops will provide a meeting for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly  ore focused way than the conferences themselves. Their aim is to stimulate and facilitate active exchange, interaction, and comparison of approaches, methods, and ideas related to specific topics, both theoretical and applied, in the general area of Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems as well as Cloud and Autonomic Computing. To motivate the discussion and participation of all the workshop attendants, we encourage organizers to get away of the typical "mini-conference" format of a workshop, and include more discussion sessions, panels, etc. Members from all areas of the SASO and ICCAC communities are invited to submit workshop proposals for review. Workshops on global challenges, applications or on new and emerging topics are particularly encouraged. Workshops can vary in length, but most will be one full day in duration. Optionally, if desired by the organizers, workshop proceedings can be published through IEEE. Attendance of workshops will be included in the registration fee for the main SASO/ICCAC conference.
</p>
<h3>Important dates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Workshop proposal submission deadline: April 7, 2017*</li>
    <li>Workshop acceptance notification: April 14, 2017*</li>

</ul>
* Please submit your workshop proposals as soon as possible (i.e. before April 7)! We will try to decide earlier on workshop acceptance in order to give the organizers more time to solicit papers.
<h3>Requirements for submission</h3>

    <li>balance and distinctness of workshop topics, and</li>
    <li>the capacity of the conference workshop program.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Responsibilities of FAS* 2017 Workshop Chairs</h3>

	Max Hastings
	  (2015)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Another masterly rendering of military history, this time looking at the secret war.<br><br>Hastings is disparaging – with reason – of many of the claims of secret services: the information obtained by diplomats often seems radically superior and more reliable than that obtained by spies, perhaps not least because it's being interpreted in a cooler and less personally dangerous atmosphere. It's hard to disagree as far as the Second World War is concerned, given that barely a single spy changed the course of the war to any measurable degree.<br><br>There are two exceptions to Hastings' conclusion, however. One of code-breaking, where he provides a carefully balanced and even-handed treatment of all sides' cryptographic skills. He places the British efforts in a context that's all the stronger because he dispenses with myth while <i>still</i> being left with a story of epic successes: the codebreakers were able at times to exert a major influence on tactics and strategy, even while being stymied at others.<br><br>The second is the handling of double agents, and here it is the Russian efforts that really stand out. While the British XX committee scored major successes, the Russian deceptions were incredible in both their depth and extent, often completely masking the armies' intentions even after they had started manoeuvring. In many ways the Russians achieved by stealth what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fortitude" rel="nofollow noopener">Operation Fortitude</a> achieved by physical deception, and on an enormously larger scale. It was particularly interesting that Hastings pulled out the contribution of "Rudolf Abel", which I'd just read about in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27064072.Abel__The_True_Story_of_the_Spy_They_Traded_for_Gary_Powers" title="Abel: The True Story of the Spy They Traded for Gary Powers" rel="nofollow noopener">Abel: The True Story of the Spy They Traded for Gary Powers</a>, and whose contributions really deserve to be better known.

	Ursula K. Le Guin
	  (1974)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A science fiction utopian classic: how would one go about setting up an anarchist society, and what might then happen? Le Guin answers the first question by requiring a new language, new forms of relationships, new ways of naming children, and an organising principle based around the collective opinion of one's fellow-citizens in the absence of any form of compulsion. As to the second, she sees the potential for human pride and ambition even in the face of a social order explicitly predicated against them. Any desire of which someone disapproves can always be characterised as self-interest ("egoising"), which will be met with disapproval.<br><br>There are plenty of echoes in this story of the Soviet Union, especially prior to the Second World War, in which noble ambitions to re-make society showed that they could be used and weaponised by someone who was prepared to act ruthlessly in their own interest. It's the <i>way</i> in which someone acts that often conditions how people interpret their actions, giving power to anyone able to connive with a pious expression.

	Timothy Snyder
	  (2010)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A timely and excellent exploration of a forgotten battlefield.<br><br>It's easy to reduce the Second World War to the extermination camps, resistance, and large-scale battles. This book tells the story of the civilian terror visited on the people of Eastern Europe before, during, and after the period we usually regard as "fighting". From Stalin's Great Terror, through the Nazi occupation, and then the reprisals that Stalin re-visited on the "Bloodlands", it's an almost inconceivable story of loss and random death that Snyder manages to tell without falling into any of the traps or tropes that he might have done. He keeps his perspective while telling of the death of (literally) millions, with a good eye for the individual story and copious support from documents and eye witnesses. It's a uniquely valuable contribution to the literature on the war, and doubly valuable today when nationalism is once again on the march. Without thinking history will repeat itself, it still does no harm to be reminded of what can happen.

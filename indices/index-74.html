<h3>Aims and&nbsp;Scope</h3>
The aim of the Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems conference series (<span class="caps">SASO</span>) is to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of research on the foundations of engineered systems that self-adapt and self-organize. The complexity of current and emerging networks, software, and services can be characterized by issues such as scale, heterogeneity, openness, and dynamics in the environment. This has led the software engineering, distributed systems, and management communities to look for inspiration in diverse fields (e.g., complex systems, control theory, artificial intelligence, chemistry, psychology, sociology, and biology) to find new ways of designing and managing such computing systems in a principled way. In this endeavor, self-organization and self-adaptation have emerged as two promising interrelated approaches. They form the basis for many other so-called self-* properties, such as self-configuration, self-healing, or self-optimization. <span class="caps">SASO</span> aims to be an interdisciplinary meeting, where contributions from participants with different backgrounds leads to the fostering of a cross-pollination of ideas, and where innovative theories, frameworks, methodologies, tools, and applications can emerge.

The eleventh edition of the <span class="caps">SASO</span> conference embraces this inter-disciplinary nature, and welcomes novel contributions to both the foundational and application-focused dimensions of self-adaptive and self-organizing systems research. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Systems theory: nature-inspired and socially-inspired paradigms and heuristics; inter-operation of self-* mechanisms; theoretical frameworks and models; control&nbsp;theory;</li>
    <li>System properties: robustness; resilience; stability; anti-fragility; diversity; self-reference and reflection; emergent behavior; computational awareness and&nbsp;self-awareness;</li>
    <li>Systems engineering: reusable mechanisms and algorithms; design patterns; architectures; methodologies; software and middleware development frameworks and methods; platforms and toolkits; multi-agent&nbsp;systems;</li>
    <li>Theory and practice of organization: self-governance, change management, electronic institutions, distributed consensus, commons, knowledge management, and the general use of rules, policies, etc. in self-*&nbsp;systems</li>
    <li>Theory and practice of adaptation: mechanisms for adaptation, including evolution, logic, learning; adaptability, plasticity,&nbsp;flexibility</li>
    <li>Socio-technical systems: human and social factors; visualization; crowdsourcing and collective awareness; humans-in-the-loop; ethics and humanities in self-*&nbsp;systems;</li>
    <li>Data-driven approaches: data mining; machine learning; data science and other statistical techniques to analyze, understand, and manage behavior of complex&nbsp;systems;</li>
    <li>Self-adaptive and self-organizing hardware: self-* materials; self-construction; reconfigurable&nbsp;hardware;</li>
    <li>Education: experience reports; curricula; innovative course concepts; methodological aspects of self-* systems&nbsp;education;</li>
    <li>Applications and experiences with self-* systems in any of the following domains are of particular interest:
<ul>
<li>Smart systems: smart grids, smart cities, smart environments, smart homes,&nbsp;etc.</li>
    <li>Industrial automation: embedded self-* systems, adaptive industrial plants, Industry 4.0, cyber physical&nbsp;systems</li>
    <li>Transportation: autonomous vehicles, traffic&nbsp;optimization</li>
    <li>Autonomous systems: aerial vehicles, undersea vehicles, autonomous&nbsp;robotics</li>
    <li>Internet of Things: self-* for network management, self-* applied to cyber&nbsp;security</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
We are looking for contributions that present new fundamental understanding of self-adaptive and self-organizing systems and how they can be engineered and used, including: novel theoretical or experimental results, novel design patterns, mechanisms, system architectures, frameworks, tools, and practical experiences in building or deploying systems and applications. Contributions contrasting different approaches for engineering a given family of systems, or demonstrating the applicability of a certain approach for different systems, are equally encouraged. Likewise, papers describing substantial innovation or insights in the use and communication of self-* systems in the classroom are welcome.

Where relevant and appropriate, accepted papers will also be encouraged to participate in the Demo or Poster Sessions.

<h3>Submission&nbsp;Instructions</h3>
Submissions can be up to 10 pages, formatted according to the standard <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Computer Society Press proceedings style guide, and submitted electronically in <span class="caps">PDF</span> format. Please submit your papers using the <span class="caps">SASO</span> 2017 conference management system:

<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2017" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2017</a>.

The proceedings will be published by <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Computer Society Press, and made available as a part of the <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Digital Library. Note that a separate Call for Poster and Demo Submissions will also be issued. As per the standard <span class="caps">IEEE</span> policies, all submissions should be original, i.e., they should not have been previously published in any conference proceedings, book, or journal and should not currently be under review for another archival conference. We also highlight <span class="caps">IEEE</span>âs policies regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism (<a href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/ID_Plagiarism.html" target="_blank">http://www.ieee.org/&#8230;/ID_Plagiarism.html</a>).
<h3>Review&nbsp;Criteria</h3>
Papers should present novel ideas in the cross-disciplinary research context described in this call, motivated by problems from current practice or applied research. Both theoretical and empirical contributions should be highlighted, substantiated by formal analysis, simulation, experimental evaluations, or comparative studies, etc. Appropriate references must be made to related work. Because <span class="caps">SASO</span> is a cross-disciplinary conference, we encourage papers to be intelligible and relevant to researchers who are not members of the same specialized sub-field.

Authors are also encouraged to submit papers describing applications. Application papers should provide an indication of the real-world relevance of the problem that is solved, including a description of the domain, and an evaluation of performance, usability, or comparison to alternative approaches. Experience papers are also welcome, especially if they highlight insights into any aspect of design, implementation or management of self-* systems that would be of benefit to practitioners and the <span class="caps">SASO</span> community. All submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed and evaluated based on the quality of their technical contribution, originality, soundness, significance, presentation, understanding of the state of the art, and overall quality.

			<p>Workshops now open for the Â <span class="caps">FAS</span>* (<span class="caps">ICCAC</span> and <span class="caps">SASO</span>) conferences in Arizona in September

<!--more-->

The <span class="caps">FAS</span>* 2017 Steering Committee invites proposals for the Workshop Program to be held along with the technical conferences <span class="caps">SASO</span> 2017 and <span class="caps">ICCAC</span> 2017. <span class="caps">FAS</span>*W workshops will provide a meeting for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly Â ore focused way than the conferences themselves. Their aim is to stimulate and facilitate active exchange, interaction, and comparison of approaches, methods, and ideas related to specific topics, both theoretical and applied, in the general area of Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems as well as Cloud and Autonomic Computing. To motivate the discussion and participation of all the workshop attendants, we encourage organizers to get away of the typical &#8220;mini-conference&#8221; format of a workshop, and include more discussion sessions, panels, etc. Members from all areas of the <span class="caps">SASO</span> and <span class="caps">ICCAC</span> communities are invited to submit workshop proposals for review. Workshops on global challenges, applications or on new and emerging topics are particularly encouraged. Workshops can vary in length, but most will be one full day in duration. Optionally, if desired by the organizers, workshop proceedings can be published through <span class="caps">IEEE</span>. Attendance of workshops will be included in the registration fee for the main <span class="caps">SASO</span>/<span class="caps">ICCAC</span>&nbsp;conference.

	Max Hastings&nbsp;(2015)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Another masterly rendering of military history, this time looking at the secret war.<br><br>Hastings is disparaging â with reason â of many of the claims of secret services: the information obtained by diplomats often seems radically superior and more reliable than that obtained by spies, perhaps not least because it&#8217;s being interpreted in a cooler and less personally dangerous atmosphere. It&#8217;s hard to disagree as far as the Second World War is concerned, given that barely a single spy changed the course of the war to any measurable degree.<br><br>There are two exceptions to Hastings&#8217; conclusion, however. One of code-breaking, where he provides a carefully balanced and even-handed treatment of all sides&#8217; cryptographic skills. He places the British efforts in a context that&#8217;s all the stronger because he dispenses with myth while <i>still</i> being left with a story of epic successes: the codebreakers were able at times to exert a major influence on tactics and strategy, even while being stymied at others.<br><br>The second is the handling of double agents, and here it is the Russian efforts that really stand out. While the British <span class="caps">XX</span> committee scored major successes, the Russian deceptions were incredible in both their depth and extent, often completely masking the armies&#8217; intentions even after they had started manoeuvring. In many ways the Russians achieved by stealth what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fortitude" rel="nofollow noopener">Operation Fortitude</a> achieved by physical deception, and on an enormously larger scale. It was particularly interesting that Hastings pulled out the contribution of &#8220;Rudolf Abel&#8221;, which I&#8217;d just read about in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27064072.Abel__The_True_Story_of_the_Spy_They_Traded_for_Gary_Powers" title="Abel: The True Story of the Spy They Traded for Gary Powers" rel="nofollow noopener">Abel: The True Story of the Spy They Traded for Gary Powers</a>, and whose contributions really deserve to be better&nbsp;known.

	Ursula K. Le Guin&nbsp;(1974)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A science fiction utopian classic: how would one go about setting up an anarchist society, and what might then happen? Le Guin answers the first question by requiring a new language, new forms of relationships, new ways of naming children, and an organising principle based around the collective opinion of one&#8217;s fellow-citizens in the absence of any form of compulsion. As to the second, she sees the potential for human pride and ambition even in the face of a social order explicitly predicated against them. Any desire of which someone disapproves can always be characterised as self-interest (&#8220;egoising&#8221;), which will be met with disapproval.<br><br>There are plenty of echoes in this story of the Soviet Union, especially prior to the Second World War, in which noble ambitions to re-make society showed that they could be used and weaponised by someone who was prepared to act ruthlessly in their own interest. It&#8217;s the <i>way</i> in which someone acts that often conditions how people interpret their actions, giving power to anyone able to connive with a pious&nbsp;expression.

      A timely and excellent exploration of a forgotten battlefield.<br><br>It&#8217;s easy to reduce the Second World War to the extermination camps, resistance, and large-scale battles. This book tells the story of the civilian terror visited on the people of Eastern Europe before, during, and after the period we usually regard as &#8220;fighting&#8221;. From Stalin&#8217;s Great Terror, through the Nazi occupation, and then the reprisals that Stalin re-visited on the &#8220;Bloodlands&#8221;, it&#8217;s an almost inconceivable story of loss and random death that Snyder manages to tell without falling into any of the traps or tropes that he might have done. He keeps his perspective while telling of the death of (literally) millions, with a good eye for the individual story and copious support from documents and eye witnesses. It&#8217;s a uniquely valuable contribution to the literature on the war, and doubly valuable today when nationalism is once again on the march. Without thinking history will repeat itself, it still does no harm to be reminded of what can&nbsp;happen.

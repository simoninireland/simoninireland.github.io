      A deeply creative world-building novel that builds a city protected by magic in a world that&#8217;s clearly set against it.<br><br>It&#8217;s a novel in a style that doesn&#8217;t explain its premises but lets the reader infer what&#8217;s happening from the details of the small-scale presentation. In this it&#8217;s not always entirely successful, and even by the end there are a lot of loose ends – which I suppose set the stage for the&nbsp;sequel.

      A biography of a much-romanticised Russian spy. Sorge spied on Japan while working for the Nazis while working for the Soviets. His fame rests on his determination of the date of Pearl Harbour (which Stalin didn&#8217;t pass on to the Americans), and his confirmation that Japan would not attack the Russian East (which Stalin was slow to believe) that allowed the Red Army to transfer a huge number of troops to fight and defeat the Wehrmacht at the gates of Stalingrad: one of the battles that decisively determined the outcome of the Second World War.<br><br>He was clearly a complex and troubled man, as many spies are. His cover as a hard-drinking womaniser wasn&#8217;t much of an act, and he spent Moscow&#8217;s money freely to keep in character. But he was also very badly served by his handlers, routinely disbelieved and threatened with the Stalinist purges, and sent a succession of inept collaborators. His commitment to Communism was sufficient to ride-out these challenges.<br><br>I would have liked to have read more about his &#8220;afterlife&#8221; in press and politics: it&#8217;s only covered briefly here, but there&#8217;s clearly a lot to be learned from his later rehabilitation and promotion as a Soviet&nbsp;idealist.

<h2 id="org0c1efed">New release of&nbsp;epydemic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0c1efed">
<p>
It&#8217;s been a while – about 15 months since v.1.13.1 – but today I
finally released v.1.14.1&nbsp;of <code>epydemic</code>, a library for epidemic (and)
other simulation over complex&nbsp;networks.
</p>

<p>
This release include several bug-fixes and two major&nbsp;changes.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb28d1d3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb28d1d3">Better Newman-Ziff&nbsp;percolation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb28d1d3">
<p>
The Newman-Ziff algorithm for bond and site percolation is widely
used. The version that&#8217;s been&nbsp;in <code>epydemic</code> for a while emphasise
speed over everything. However, in the course of some work by one
of my MSc students on how grids of different dimensions respond to
random failure, we discovered that we needed to be able to do some
more flexible operations. In particular, we wanted to sample things
other than just the size of the largest connected component, and
wanted to be able to dig into to exactly how the network was&nbsp;deforming.
</p>

<p>
The problem was that this information wasn&#8217;t readily available. It
<i>was</i> encoded within the algorithm&#8217;s data structure, but it wasn&#8217;t
being reflected as an evolving network that was easy to get at. So
we upgraded the algorithm to build a working copy of the network as
it was constructed, so that it could be interrogated by&nbsp;normal <code>networkx</code> operations within the sampling process. This adds
some time penalty, but it&#8217;s acceptable slowdown for the extra&nbsp;capability.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org88cc177" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org88cc177">Multiple process&nbsp;instances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org88cc177">
<p>
<code>epydemic</code> defines different epidemic processes (and indeed
non-disease processes like pulse-coupled oscillators). Until now
these have been usable alone in a simulation, but not together: one
couldn&#8217;t run <i>two</i> diseases in the <i>same</i> simulation over the <i>same</i>
population simultaneously. Doing so is obviously very desirable,
especially if you want to explore co-infecting&nbsp;diseases.
</p>

<p>
Co-infection is a difficult problem. As a first step we&#8217;ve added
multiple process instances which can have their own parameters and
results – or can share parameters if required. This involves
assigning distinct names to each instance, and then optionally
using them to decorate parameter/result&nbsp;names.
</p>

<p>
This is fiddly if done manually, so we also added some methods on&nbsp;the <code>Process</code> class to get and set parameters and results using any
instance name on the calling process. For&nbsp;example:
</p>

The <code>setParameters</code> call sets the parameters decorated with the name

extracting the parameters, and for interacting with experimental
results without getting into the details of&nbsp;decoration.

</p>

<p>
In some ways this article should come under &#8220;applications&#8221;, as
it&#8217;s mainly concerned with using Lisp to represent and manipulate
music. Indeed, it presents a system that can be used to perform
all sorts of common transformations of the tones and timing of a
piece. It&#8217;s easy to see how the resulting system could be used to
compose and then to drive instruments, for example through a <span class="caps">MIDI</span>&nbsp;interface.
</p>

<p>
The music perspective is however secondary to the goal of teaching
and showcasing Lisp through the medium of a realistic example of
symbolic programming. It covers a lot of ground, starting with
lists and functions and including first-class functions and
combinators as means of implementing the musical structures. It&#8217;s
a great piece of pedagogy that treats the application and the
language as closely linked, and not shying-away from some quite
advanced techniques that have clear applications in the domain. It
would be great to see this used as a basis for actual musical
composition and&nbsp;performance.

      Ray Dalio has always been a somewhat divisive figure in finance. He&#8217;s been a remarkably successful fund manager who rose from nothing to head an enormously powerful and innovative group.<br><br>But like many successful businessmen, Dalio seemed unable to rest on that success. He developed &#8220;the rules&#8221; as a template for his success, and within Bridgewater insisted that they form part of everyone&#8217;s mindset. He supplemented this with public shamings of a style that can only be likened to the &#8220;struggle sessions&#8221; of the Cultiral Revolution, with the target being required to confess their wrongdoings and promise improvement – often as a direct precursor to being demoted or fired. But of course the &#8220;rules&#8221; were infinitely malleable to match Dalio&#8217;s own needs of the moment, making them a tool of control rather than any kind of proper guide to conduct.<br><br>A lot of this was public knowledge, but forgiven by investors and collaborator because of the returns that Bridgewater generated. That&#8217;s a recurring theme in finance, for example as recounted in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7740121.No_One_Would_Listen" title="No One Would Listen by Harry Markopolos" rel="nofollow noopener">No One Would Listen</a>, and encourages a culture of impunity when accompanied by&nbsp;profits.

      A narrative history of the rise of Al Qaeda and the consequences for the world.<br><br>I read this book after I&#8217;d seen the recent television drama based on it. They cover substantially different ground, with the book rooted firmly in the origins and history of the group rather than in the few years preceding 9/11. It focuses quite intensively on Ayman al Zawahiri, whose struggle against the Egyptian government led to his eventual exile in Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden, by contrast is – if not quite a bit player – then certainly a peripheral and rather transparent figure whose commitment to revolution arrives very late and in a surprisingly hesitant fashion – but is then absolutely decisive in both the tactics and strategy of the fight against the <span class="caps">US</span> and its allies. Altogether a fascinating cast of&nbsp;characters,

    <p>
      A re-telling of some of the core Norse legends by a master of science fiction. Gaiman&#8217;s drawn heavily on Norse mythology in his &#8220;Sandman&#8221; series, especially in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25101.Season_of_Mists__The_Sandman___4_" title="Season of Mists (The Sandman, #4) by Neil Gaiman" rel="nofollow noopener">Season of Mists</a>. But he does a fantastic job of rendering the stories in prose too, with a carefully chosen selection and a voice that&#8217;s perfectly pitched: not trying to be modern, but not being self-consciously archaic or imitative either. In many ways the only shame is that it&#8217;s too little taken from such a large body of possible&nbsp;tales.

      A narrative history of the Order of the Poor Knights of the Temple (to give them their full name). In less than a century the Templars went from nothing, to the most powerful military and commercial order in Europe, and then back to nothing, being destroyed for their money.<br><br>That they could disappear so completely is, as Jones points out, one of the reasons why they&#8217;ve given rise to so much fanciful speculation in the eight centuries since: how <i>could</i> an order of warrior knights allow themselves to be rounded up and (in some cases) burned? Wouldn&#8217;t they have fought, or at least gone underground? Jones makes a convincing case for the fact that the Western half of the Order were mainly farmers and administrators rather than knights <i>per se</i>, and may never have expected to be so thoroughly and ruthlessly persecuted as they in fact were. He supports his case by the fact that the Knights Hospitaller, a contemporary and equally powerful Order, were left unmolested largely because they had a secure military base on Rhodes from which they could have resisted attempts to suppress them (and indeed have survived as a sovereign nation recognised by international law ever since).<br><br>The truth is a lot more compelling than any pseudo-history, and illuminates the shifting alliances and power politics of thirteenth century Europe very clearly. It also shows how fragile the whole crusader expedition to the Holy Land (Outremer) was in reality, being constantly in need or reinforcement from a distance and at a constant disadvantage to the Muslim armies fighting closer to home, albeit often with the same degree of internal politics and variable levels of&nbsp;support.

<a href="https://saso2018.fbk.eu/">12th <span class="caps">IEEE</span> International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (<span class="caps">SASO</span> 2018)</a>
3-7 September 2018, Trento,&nbsp;Italy</h3>
<h4>Aims and&nbsp;Motivation</h4>
The aim of the Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems conference series (<span class="caps">SASO</span>) is to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of research on the foundations of engineered systems that self-adapt and self-organize. The complexity of current and emerging networks, software, and services can be characterized by issues such as scale, heterogeneity, openness, and dynamics in the environment. This has led the software engineering, distributed systems, and management communities to look for inspiration in diverse fields (e.g., complex systems, control theory, artificial intelligence, chemistry, psychology, sociology, and biology) to find new ways of designing and managing such computing systems in a principled way. In this endeavor, self-organization and self-adaptation have emerged as two promising interrelated approaches. They form the basis of many other so-called self-* properties, such as self-configuration, self-healing, or self-optimization. <span class="caps">SASO</span> aims to be an interdisciplinary meeting, where contributions from participants with different backgrounds leads to the fostering of a cross-pollination of ideas, and where innovative theories, frameworks, methodologies, tools, and applications can emerge.
<h4>Scope</h4>
The twelfth edition of the <span class="caps">SASO</span> conference embraces this interdisciplinary nature, and welcomes novel contributions to both the foundational and application-focused dimensions of self-adaptive and self-organizing systems research. We are looking for contributions that present new fundamental understanding of self-adaptive and self-organizing systems and how they can be engineered and used. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Self-* Systems theory</strong>: nature-inspired and socially-inspired paradigms and heuristics; inter-operation of self-* mechanisms; theoretical frameworks and models; control&nbsp;theory;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Self-* System properties</strong>: robustness; resilience; stability; anti-fragility; diversity; self-reference and reflection; emergent behavior; computational awareness and&nbsp;self-awareness;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Self-* Systems engineering</strong>: reusable mechanisms and algorithms; design patterns; architectures; methodologies; software and middleware development frameworks and methods; platforms and toolkits; multi-agent&nbsp;systems;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Theory and practice of self-organization</strong>: self-governance, change management, electronic institutions, distributed consensus, commons, knowledge management, and the general use of rules, policies, etc. in self-*&nbsp;systems;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Theory and practice of self-adaptation</strong>: mechanisms for adaptation, including evolution, logic, learning; adaptability, plasticity,&nbsp;flexibility;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Socio-technical self-* systems</strong>: human and social factors; visualization; crowdsourcing and collective awareness; humans-in-the-loop; ethics and humanities in self-*&nbsp;systems;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Data-driven approaches to self-* systems</strong>: data mining; machine learning; data science and other statistical techniques to analyze, understand, and manage the behavior of complex&nbsp;systems;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Self-adaptive and self-organizing hardware</strong>: self-* materials; self-construction; reconfigurable&nbsp;hardware;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Self-* Systems Education</strong>: experience reports; curricula; innovative course concepts; methodological aspects of self-* systems&nbsp;education;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Applications and experiences with self-* systems</strong>: smart grid, smart cities, smart homes, adaptive industrial plants, cyber-physical systems; autonomous vehicles and robotics; traffic management; self-adaptive cyber-security; Internet of Things; fog/edge computing;&nbsp;etc.</li>

<h4>Submission&nbsp;Instructions</h4>
Submissions can have up to 10 pages formatted according to the standard <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Computer Society Press proceedings style guide (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">see templates here</a>). Please submit your papers electronically in <span class="caps">PDF</span> format using the <span class="caps">SASO</span> 2018 conference management system:
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2018</a>.

The proceedings will be published by <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Computer Society Press, and made available as a part of the <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Digital Library. Note that a separate Call for Poster and Demo Submissions will also be issued. As per the standard <span class="caps">IEEE</span> policies, all submissions should be original, i.e., they should not have been previously published in any conference proceedings, book, or journal and should not currently be under review for another archival conference. We would like to also highlight <span class="caps">IEEE</span>’s policies regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism (<a href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/ID_Plagiarism.html">http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/ID_Plagiarism.html</a>).

Where relevant and appropriate, accepted papers will also be encouraged to participate in the Demo or Poster Sessions.
<h4>Review&nbsp;Criteria</h4>
Papers should present novel ideas in the cross-disciplinary research context described in this call, motivated by problems from current practice or applied research. Both theoretical and empirical contributions should be highlighted, substantiated by formal analysis, simulation, experimental evaluations, or comparative studies, etc. Appropriate references must be made to related work. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the <span class="caps">SASO</span> conference, we encourage papers to be intelligible and relevant to researchers who are not members of the same specialized sub-field.

Authors are also encouraged to submit papers describing applications. Application papers should provide an indication of the real-world relevance of the problem that is solved, including a description of the domain, and an evaluation of performance, usability, or comparison to alternative approaches. Experience papers are also welcome, especially if they highlight insights into any aspect of design, implementation or management of self-* systems that would be of benefit to practitioners and the <span class="caps">SASO</span> community. All submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed and evaluated based on the quality of their technical contribution, originality, soundness, significance, presentation, understanding of the state of the art, and overall quality.

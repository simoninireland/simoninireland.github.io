      A thoughtful look at modelling by an experienced climate modeller.<br><br>What are models <i>for</i>? The most common answer would be &#8220;to predict the future behaviour of some system,&#8221; but Thompson argues a far more subtle line: that the most important models often <i>fail</i> to be predictive in any real sense. Much of this is down to problems of validation, especially in climate models for which we have no experience of the world the models are trying to predict.<br><br>An even more subtle mistake is regarding all models as &#8220;cameras&#8221; that simply observe the world. That&#8217;s true for the more abstract kinds of modelling, where one is trying to understand possible behaviours of systems in general without tying them to specific circumstances. But the models with which most people are familiar act ore like &#8220;engines&#8221; that can perturb the system they&#8217;re purporting simply to observe by baing used as drivers for policy. Climate and epidemic models seek to warn as well as predict and understand, but this exacerbates the problems of validation: if the model&#8217;s predictions <i>don&#8217;t</i> come to pass, perhaps this is because policy-makers took corrective actions in response, or maybe bacause they didn&#8217;t intervent effectively enough. This isn&#8217;t a reason to give up on modelling altogether: how else are we to understand complex systems, and how else are we to respond rationally to them? But it does mean that the notion of &#8220;following the science&#8221; problematic.<br><br>Thompson also wrestles with the problem of groupthink amongst modellers, who often share a common overallping background. I agree this is a problem, but the idea that we can increase diversity in the community easily seems flawed to me. Modellers share a scientific viewpoint and a belief in modelling, and no-one who doesn&#8217;t will ever be able to effectively engage with the models or their arguments. Perhaps it&#8217;s enough that scientists are always advisors and never decision-makers, and allow politicians to deal with the integration of different choices and values – although that split isn&#8217;t always appreciated by the public, and is often (as in the covid-19 pandemic) deliberately blurred to allow less-trusted politicians to draw credibility from more-trusted scientists and doctors.<br><br>Overall I think this is a lucid and valiant attempt to summarise and explore the benefits and limitations of models, and science in general, when it impacts directly on the wider world. It deserves to be widely read in the scientific community so that we can better understand our place in policies that we often unavoidably have to influence.<br><br></p>

An interview on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeveloperVoices">Developer Voices</a> podcast with <a href="https://www.schafmeistergroup.com/">Prof Christian
Schafmeister</a> on designing enzymes using a custom dialect of Lisp
to control computational chemistry&nbsp;libraries.
</p>

<p>
He initially started from an idea based on <span class="caps">CAD</span> applications
(written in Smalltalk), but rapidly realised there were too many
possible components and combinations to work with graphically and
so started treating it as a language-design problem – and
designed a custom Lisp based on <a href="https://ecl.common-lisp.dev/"><span class="caps">ECL</span></a>. Lisp provides simplicity and
efficiency, as well as being a &#8220;forever&#8221; language in which
software keeps working over the long&nbsp;term.

<span class="caps">SIGPLAN</span> Notices <b>13</b>, pp.215–216.&nbsp;1978.
</p>

<p>
A &#8220;manual&#8221; in the sense of providing a complete implementation of
Lisp – in Lisp&nbsp;itself.
</p>

<p>
Is that useful? A semantics expert would say &#8220;no&#8221;, since such a
model has no real explanatory power: the recursion doesn&#8217;t
bottom-out to define the concepts. However, a programming language
expert might disagree and observe that this is <i>meta-linguistic
abstraction</i>, the use of one high-level language to capture the
definition of another. The &#8220;host&#8221; language provides a higher level
of abstraction than is usual when writing interpreters and
compilers, so it becomes easier to experiment with different forms
of &#8220;target&#8221; language as there&#8217;s less low-level work to do. This
benefit exists even when host and target are the same: essentially
the target is bootstrapped and can then be adjusted while running
within an earlier version of&nbsp;itself.
</p>

<p>
As far as I know this is the first example of meta-linguistic
abstraction in the computer science literature. The idea was
popularised by <a href="/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/"><span class="caps">SICP</span></a> (using Scheme), and forms the basis for a lot
of modern bootstrapped&nbsp;compilers.

</p>

<p>
A description of the architecture later built and sold by&nbsp;<span class="caps">LMI</span>.
</p>

<p>
A visionary description of a machine to run Lisp at a
&#8220;non-prohibitive cost&#8221; of $70,000 per system. (The web tells me
that this is the equivalent of <a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1974?amount=70000">$440,000</a> in 2024.) A completely
integrated system based on a Cons processor and using a <span class="caps">PDP</span>-11 as
a console. A relocating, compacting, garbage collector with
invisible forwarding pointers. Non-linear spaghetti stacks to
support advanced programming&nbsp;constructs.
</p>

<p>
One of the many notable facets of this design is one of its
proposals (the &#8220;frame pushdown list&#8221;) to avoid excessive conses
and garbage collection overhead by maintaining lists of blocks of
particular sizes. It uses this approach to manage the creation of
call stack frames; modern Python implementations use this scheme
throughout to avoid heap fragmentation through allocating and
re-allocating blocks of different sizes. (Lisp has this feature
generally, of course, with its use of fixed-size cons&nbsp;cells.)
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s also fascinating to see that, even at this early stage,
hardware design was being seen as an exercise in refinement to
maintain software-level abstractions even as features were being
pushed into hardware – while still providing optimised
implementations that were invisible to the&nbsp;programmer.

</p>

<p>
A short, practical guide to build a dynamic web site entirely
using Common Lisp. Makes extensive use of several libraries,
including the intriguingly-named <a href="https://edicl.github.io/hunchentoot/">hunchentoot</a> web server (named
after a never-staged musical written by Frank Zappa), the <a href="https://edicl.github.io/cl-who/"><span class="caps">CL</span>-<span class="caps">WHO</span></a>
<span class="caps">HTML</span> generator, and – perhaps most interesting – the <a href="https://cliki.net/Parenscript">Parenscript</a>
Lisp to Javascript&nbsp;compiler.
</p>

<p>
One gain from using Lisp is the ability to wrap-up standard
constructions like page templates as macros. Other than this, it&#8217;s
hard to assess whether the gains are all that significant. One
interesting point is that the whole development occurs in Lisp, so
there&#8217;s no cognitive dissonance between writing the back-end and
the front-end: essentially the same argument for using <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> as
a back-end framework. While Parenscript isn&#8217;t a fully-featured
Lisp-in-the-browser it again can benefit from macros and other
features. There&#8217;s a throwaway comment about linking it to <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>,
although that isn&#8217;t demonstrated in practice: it feels intriguing,
though, especially if there&#8217;s a way to represent jQuery
functionality idiomatically in&nbsp;Lisp.

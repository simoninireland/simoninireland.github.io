    <p>
      An excellent telling of one of the strangest, most influential, and least remembered judicial-political scandals of the 19th century. Read deftly navigates the twists and turns of &#8220;The Affair&#8221;, as it became known, with its cast of shady characters, officers, politicians, forgers, and spies.<br><br>It&#8217;s an anti-Semitism that comes across most shockingly, letters-to-the-editor type abuses of Jews that would be unsurprising in a history of Nazi Germany but are unexpectedly vehement in a history of France. It serves as a reminder that anti-Semitism was a force across the continent in the early years of the 20th century, and Read traces many of the effects that it had on the conduct of both World Wars. Altogether a fascinating&nbsp;read.

	Vance Packard&nbsp;(1957)

      The classic exposé of advertising. In many ways this book remains fresh, perhaps because of the popularity of <i>Mad Men</i> in bringing 50&#8217;s advertising culture back to prominence. In others, it hasn&#8217;t aged well and is clearly a product of its time. If you can get back the casual sexism and references to tobacco&#8217;s &#8220;cancer scare&#8221;, however, it&#8217;s still a great read.<br><br>I found it impossible to read this book without thinking of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2527900.Nudge_Improving_Decisions_About_Health__Wealth__and_Happiness" title="Nudge Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness by Richard H. Thaler" rel="nofollow noopener">Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</a>, another exploration of how to affect people&#8217;s behaviour &#8220;for their own good&#8221;. It&#8217;s hard to decide which is more insidious. While advertising has undoubtedly had long-term effects on our behaviour in the half-century since Packard wrote, it&#8217;s also true that many of the techniques being espoused are now so obvious that they&#8217;ve ceased to be effective: I sometimes wonder whether advertising now almost <i>has</i> to be ironic just to get past people&#8217;s media filters. As a thoughtful introduction from a time just starting to show the complexities of the modern world, though, this book is hard to&nbsp;beat.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      An excellent brief history of India&#8217;s most dramatic rulers.<br><br>Two elements really stand out. The first is the Gascoigne is an excellent art historian, able to put the architecture of the Moghuls into perspective and sometimes rejecting the conventional readings of the various buildings. Secondly, he highlights some of the facets of &#8220;harem culture&#8221; that seem incomprehensible to modern readers, the influence of sequestered wives, favourites, and concubines on their emperors. <br><br>Actually there&#8217;s a third element worth noting. Perhaps cleaving to the &#8220;brief&#8221; part of the title, Gascoigne leaves off his history halfway through what would conventionally be regarded as the lifespan of the Moghuls, stopping with the death of Aurangzeb. He covers the lives of six great Moghuls and relegates the final eleven to an epilogue, considering that their influence and grandeur waned so fast that they cannot stand next to their great forbears. This certainly demonstrates enviable confidence from an author, but it&#8217;s impossible not to agree that Gascoigne&#8217;s brevity keeps the drama and excitement of the earlier history intact and&nbsp;vibrant.

      There aren&#8217;t many books or poems that need (or deserve) another book to explain them, but Dante&#8217;s <i>Commedia</i> is one, and this is an excellent guide.<br><br>Reading Dante isn&#8217;t the usual guide book, though. Instead of following the structure of the poem, it picks out a few themes (love, power, the use of language) and traces them through the complete hierarchy of hell, purgatory, and heaven. Along the way it provides a vital guide to the social and political context of 14th century Italy and some sights in Florence to see and relate to Dante&#8217;s time. Linking to one of my other great loves, it&#8217;s also full of illuminated letters and images used in the various editions of <i>Commedia</i> (although sady not in colour). For someone like me who reads Dante in translation, it both highlights the effects that only come through in the original, and acts as a spur to learn Italian if for no other reason than to enjoy Dante more.<br><br>One other thing that I think I should note is the physicality of the book itself. It&#8217;s beautifully presented, with deckle-edged (unevenly torn) pages, and typeset very sympathetically. Altogether a delight to read, although often quite&nbsp;intense.

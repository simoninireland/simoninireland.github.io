Special Track of the 32nd <span class="caps">ACM</span> Symposium on Applied Computing (<span class="caps">SAC</span>&#8216;17)
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://sac-cas2017.apice.unibo.it">http://sac-cas2017.apice.unibo.it</a>
April 3 - 7, 2017 Marrakech, Morocco

Nowadays, most aspects of our daily life are affected by pervasive technology, consisting of massive numbers of heterogeneous units/nodes (computers, devices, software applications, smart objects, etc.), complex interactions, and humans-in-the-loop. The distributed and open nature of these systems and their large scale make sensing, decision-making, planning and acting possibly highly dispersed: this may cause on the one hand the emergence of unexpected phenomena, but on the other hand it can be the key to support inherent adaptation and resilience.

These complex systems are typically referred to as Collective Adaptive Systems (<span class="caps">CAS</span>). They have to be equipped with dynamic and autonomous adaptation capabilities, to deal with changes in their working environments and within themselves. <span class="caps">CAS</span> involve huge collections of cooperating components, trading off individual tasks, properties, objectives and actions, with overall system goals.

To properly engineer and exploit <span class="caps">CAS</span>, a deep scientific understanding of the principles underpinning their operation is required. The development of <span class="caps">CAS</span> is closely related to other contemporary (software) engineering approaches, such as component-based systems and middleware platforms, as well as other Computer Science areas, such as Distributed Artificial Intelligence, Formal Methods, Agent-based Programming, Pervasive Computing, Internet of Things, and Autonomic Computing. This track aims at providing a common forum for discussing the various different viewpoints over <span class="caps">CAS</span>, attracting relevant and consistent contributions from different research communities, with the ultimate goal of filling the gap between theory and practice, hence paving the way towards implementation of relevant applications.

The Special Track on Collective Adaptive Systems takes deliberately a broad view of what <span class="caps">CAS</span> are and how they should be designed, analysed, built and deployed. In particular, the track&#8217;s interest is both in the foundational view (e.g., theories, methods, formalisms, models) and the practical aspects (e.g., development methodologies, programming languages, middleware, development and runtime environments, tools). Moreover, also applications of <span class="caps">CAS</span> solutions to real-world case studies are welcomed.

Major topics of interest this year will include the following:
<ul>
<li>Novel models, languages, programming and implementation techniques for&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li><span class="caps">CAS</span> technologies and&nbsp;infrastructures</li>
    <li><span class="caps">CAS</span>&nbsp;applications</li>
    <li>Scenarios, case studies and experience reports of&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Formal aspects (semantics, reasoning, verification) in <span class="caps">CAS</span>&nbsp;development</li>
    <li>Business Processes in <span class="caps">CAS</span> - Self-* and emerging properties of&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Security and privacy in <span class="caps">CAS</span> - Policy-based coordination and self-adaptation in&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Middleware platforms for&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Software architectures and engineering methodologies for&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Proceedings</h3>
Papers accepted for the Special Track on Collective Adaptive Systems will be published by <span class="caps">ACM</span> both in the <span class="caps">SAC</span> 2017 proceedings and in the Digital Library.

<span class="caps">CAS</span> Special Track organisers also plan to invite authors of selected papers for a Special Issue in a high impact journal, such as <span class="caps">ACM</span> Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems or Science of Computer Programming.
<h3>Paper submission and&nbsp;format</h3>
All papers should represent original and previously unpublished works that currently are not under review in any conference or journal.

The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must <span class="caps">NOT</span> appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should be in the third person. This is to facilitate blind review. Only the title should be shown at the first page without the authors&#8217; information.

Submitted papers must be in the <span class="caps">ACM</span> two-column page format (doc template, pdf template, latex template). The length of the papers is 6 pages (included in the registration) plus up to 2 extra pages (at extra charge), i.e. total 8 pages maximum.

Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending <span class="caps">SAC</span> <span class="caps">MUST</span> present the paper: This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the <span class="caps">ACM</span>/<span class="caps">IEEE</span> digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the <span class="caps">ACM</span>/<span class="caps">IEEE</span> digital library.

Submission is entirely automated via the <span class="caps">STAR</span> Submission System, which is available from:
<ul>
<li>(for regular papers) <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.softconf.com/h/sac2017/">https://www.softconf.com/h/sac2017/</a>
</li>
    <li>(for <span class="caps">SRC</span> papers) <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.softconf.com/h/sac-src2017/">https://www.softconf.com/h/sac-src2017/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Poster&nbsp;Sessions</h3>
Papers that received high reviews (that is acceptable by reviewer standards) but were not accepted due to space limitation can be invited for the poster session. Poster should be not longer than 3 pages (included in the registration) plus 1 extra page (at extra charge), i.e. total 4 pages maximum. The poster session procedures and details will be posted on <span class="caps">SAC</span> 2017 website as soon as they become available.
<h3>Student research abstracts&nbsp;competition</h3>
Graduate students are invited to submit Student Research Competition (<span class="caps">SRC</span>) abstracts (maximum of 2 pages in <span class="caps">ACM</span> camera-ready format) following the instructions published at <span class="caps">SAC</span> 2017 website. Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers and practitioners with expertise in the track focus area to which they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts (up to 20 students) will have the opportunity to give poster and oral presentations of their work and compete for three top-winning places. The winners will receive medals, cash awards, and <span class="caps">SIGAPP</span> recognition certificates during the conference banquet. Invited students receive <span class="caps">SRC</span> travel support (<span class="caps">US</span>$500) and are eligible to apply to the <span class="caps">SIGAPP</span> Student Travel Award Program (<span class="caps">STAP</span>) for additional travel support.

      </h2>

    <p>
      A fascinating, if ultimately incomplete, exploration of the alternatives to the current web architecture that prioritises the needs of companies over those of consumers – or producers, if the truth be told. Lanier approaches the problems strictly from the perspective of information and information processing, with a clarity that I, even as a computer scientist, find refreshingly complete: it&#8217;s as though he&#8217;s willing to encompass some of the logical consequences that even professionals shy away from.<br><br>The central argument is that internet users, and especially users of social networks, are providing too much information for free to companies that then profit from it. Lanier suggests some alternative approaches to this, where content and expertise give rise to micro-payment compensation in cash or some other medium of exchange. The problem is that this is a tall order against the structures that have already grown up, and it&#8217;s unclear that it&#8217;s now possible to change tack as radically as would be required. Still, in many ways that makes this work all the more important, and it&#8217;s a great contribution to the broader literature on e-commerce and digital&nbsp;living.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A book that it&#8217;s perhaps hard for a white, middle-aged, Englishman to review, but still a powerful indictment of how America still relates to its black (and other) populations – made all the more poignant by the current spate of police shootings and the contentious presidential campaign that&#8217;s unmistakeably racist. Coates chooses to frame his argument in terms of physical threat, using it as both a metaphor and as an entrance to the more general sense of fear and danger still felt by many. He doesn&#8217;t avoid the changing face of oppression over the years, but still holds that there&#8217;s a danger to being black in America that it&#8217;s hard for whites (and non-Americans) to fully understand: perhaps the closest we can come to it in the <span class="caps">UK</span> would be the feelings of Catholics in Northern Ireland during the height of the Troubles, which was a story of privilege and discrimination that I remember being hard to accept at the&nbsp;time.

      A minor participant&#8217;s view of the making of the Treaty of Versailles.<br><br>It&#8217;s strange to see the inside view: strange to realise that the things that later generations perceived were mistakes were often understood to be mistakes at the time – but that events carried the negotiators along, and their differing beliefs and goals, as well as their incongruent personalities, made it impossible to avoid the consequences. Many world statesmen appear, and most come out reasonably well – the exception being Woodrow Wilson. This book is a great precursor, and complement, to the histories of the run-up to the next war and helps contextualise many of the events that often seem&nbsp;inexplicable.

Foundations and Applications of Self* Systems (<span class="caps">FAS</span>*) is the umbrella for two closely related but independent conferences, the International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (<span class="caps">SASO</span>) and the International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (<span class="caps">ICCAC</span>). The <span class="caps">FAS</span>* Doctoral Symposium provides an international forum for PhD Students working in research areas addressed by <span class="caps">FAS</span>*. In this forum, PhD students will get unique opportunities to subject their research to the scrutiny of external experts, gain experience in the presentation of research, connect to peers and experts addressing similar problems, and get advice from a panel of internationally leading researchers.

Different from the technical tracks of the conference, the <span class="caps">FAS</span>* Doctoral Symposium focuses on the specific needs of young researchers at the beginning of their career. As such, particular emphasis will be placed on a critical and constructive feedback that shall help participants to successfully conclude their PhD studies.

PhD students working in any area addressed by the <span class="caps">FAS</span>* conferences are invited to submit a Doctoral Symposium paper in which they describe the key motivation and objectives of their research project, and reflect on the methodology as well as the current status of their PhD studies. Complementing the thematic focus of <span class="caps">FAS</span>*, we particularly solicit contributions in the following areas:

<em>Engineering of self-organizing and self-adaptive systems.</em> We solicit theoretical and applied works addressing fundamental principles underlying self-organizing systems, as well as methods that allow to quantify, model and reproduce the self-* characteristics of complex systems in biological, social, physical and technical systems. Examples include mechanisms underlying distributed decision- making and collective intelligence, software engineering challenges in self-adaptive systems, as well as general application of self-* principles in the engineering of technical systems.

<em>Complex Cyber-physical and socio-technical systems.</em> We welcome contributions that apply self-* principles to address challenges in the design of complex cyber- physical and socio-technical systems. Particular examples include smart grid infrastructures, sensor networks, opportunistic networking scenarios, as well as large-scale social information systems. Works addressing challenges such as the security, privacy and anonymity of users, or mechanisms to prevent censorship, manipulation or unfairness in socio-technical systems are especially welcome. We further solicit works on socio- technical and socio-economic challenges in <span class="caps">P2P</span> systems, such as the design of incentive, trust and reputation mechanisms.

<em>Self-* approaches in Massive-Scale Decentralized Systems.</em> Works in this area use self-* approaches to address challenges in the design and operation of massive scale decentralized systems. Examples include Peer-to-Peer technologies, as well as overlay topology management schemes. We are further interested in decentralized data mining and machine learning approaches, as well as decentralized approaches to monitor, model and adapt distributed systems. Works using self-* principles to address the inherent challenges in the design of massive-scale systems with unreliable and heterogeneous are of particular interest.

<em>Autonomic Computing.</em> Systems Here we are interested in all works addressing the self-configuration, self-optimization and self-adaptation of cloud computing services, data centers and general distributed computing systems. Examples for questions addressed in this area include the monitoring and modeling of cloud services, the design of efficient resource allocation mechanisms, the application of data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the behavior of technical systems, as well as the characterization of distributed computing workloads.

<em>Application of Self-* in Robotics and Spatial Computing.</em> Finally, we welcome contributions using self-* principles in the areas of robotics, swarm robotics and spatial computing. Here, examples for works of interest include environmental modeling and perception, machine vision, and self-adaptation mechanisms in robotics, distributed coordination and collective intelligence in multi- robot systems, as well as novel paradigms for the programming of autonomous, spatially distributed entities.
<h4>Submission&nbsp;Instructions</h4>
Submissions should have a length of max. six pages and be formatted according to the <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Computer Society Press proceedings style guide. Authors should submit their papers using the EasyChair installation of the main conference, which is available at:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2016</a>

Please note that only single-author submissions are accepted, which focus on the topic of the doctoral work. The name of the supervisor (« supervised by &#8230; ») should be clearly marked below the author’s name in the paper. Submissions should further adhere to the following structure:
<ul>
<li>Motivation: motivate the open problem that you want to address and briefly summarize existing approaches along with their&nbsp;deficiencies.</li>
    <li>Objectives: describe the key objectives of your PhD project and argue how achieving them will solve the open problem outlined in the&nbsp;motivation.</li>
    <li>Methodology: outline what methodology you will adopt to meet the objectives of your project. Clearly state on what existing works your work will&nbsp;build.</li>
    <li>Research Plan: describe what preliminary results – if any – you have already achieved and summarize your plans for future work. Please add a rough schedule that allows to judge whether your research plan is&nbsp;feasible.</li>
</ul>
Authors of accepted papers shall prepare a final, camera ready version of the paper, taking into account all feedback from reviewers, and formatted according to the <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Computer Society Press proceedings style guide. Doctoral Symposium papers will be advertised in the final program, and will be submitted to <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Xplore as part of the <span class="caps">SASO</span> proceedings. Papers will also be made available in the <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Digital Library.
<h4>Review&nbsp;Process</h4>
Each submission will be reviewed by at least two Doctoral Symposium experts (see list below) that cover the different areas of interest of the conference. Submissions will be evaluated based on their relevance to <span class="caps">FAS</span>*, the motivation and quality of the proposed research, as well as the suitability of the chosen methodology.

Authors of accepted papers will have different opportunities to present their project at the conference. Besides a full presentation during the PhD Symposium session, an “Elevator Pitch Session” will be organized during the main conference, where authors get the chance to briefly showcase their research. In addition, the Best Doctoral Symposium paper will be selected and the award will be presented during the main conference. Finally, selected authors will have the additional chance to present their work via a poster in the poster session of the main conference.

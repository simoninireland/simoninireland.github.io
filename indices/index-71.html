	Arthur Koestler&nbsp;(1940)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A classic of &#8220;fictional history&#8221;, focusing on the Stalinist counter-revolution of the 1930&#8217;s. The protagonist, Rubashov, struggles to understand what&#8217;s happening to him as he is imprisoned, set up for a show trial, and eventually executed.<br><br>Koestler brilliantly captures something that often seems inexplicable in the history of the period: why did so many of the main characters collude in their own destruction? He makes a convincing case that they were captured by their own revolutionary logic: having professed the supremacy of the revolution, the creative use of obviously unjust violence, and the subordination of the individual, they found themselves unable to argue or act in their own defence, and even found solace in performing <i>one last act</i> that aided the revolution even as it consumed them. Still inexplicable, but also somehow admirable that individuals could become so devoted to a cause, no matter what one thinks of&nbsp;it.

	Mary Beard&nbsp;(2015)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A distinguished historian&#8217;s swan song, a history of Rome that focuses on many of the neglected aspects of the period – and on why they are neglected. The experience of slaves, or women of the poor – of which we know next to nothing – are contrasted against the experience of Cicero, the first person in history we can &#8220;know&#8221; in a modern, biographical, sense. On the way Beard explores what it meant to be Roman, and so what it meant to be a part of the Empire from the perspective of the ordinary and elite peoples far from Italy.<br><br>For me the most radical observation that Beard makes is in identifying what counts as &#8220;important&#8221; Roman history. She essentially discounts the empire and the emperors as being a footnote, something that occurred after all vibrancy and creativity had passed. For her, the Republic and the characters around it – the Gracchi, Cicero himself, Pompei and Caesar – are the elements that gave us the important things we have taken from Rome. It&#8217;s an unusual argument, compellingly&nbsp;made.

Special Track of the 32nd <span class="caps">ACM</span> Symposium on Applied Computing (<span class="caps">SAC</span>&#8216;17)
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://sac-cas2017.apice.unibo.it">http://sac-cas2017.apice.unibo.it</a>
April 3 - 7, 2017 Marrakech, Morocco

Nowadays, most aspects of our daily life are affected by pervasive technology, consisting of massive numbers of heterogeneous units/nodes (computers, devices, software applications, smart objects, etc.), complex interactions, and humans-in-the-loop. The distributed and open nature of these systems and their large scale make sensing, decision-making, planning and acting possibly highly dispersed: this may cause on the one hand the emergence of unexpected phenomena, but on the other hand it can be the key to support inherent adaptation and resilience.

These complex systems are typically referred to as Collective Adaptive Systems (<span class="caps">CAS</span>). They have to be equipped with dynamic and autonomous adaptation capabilities, to deal with changes in their working environments and within themselves. <span class="caps">CAS</span> involve huge collections of cooperating components, trading off individual tasks, properties, objectives and actions, with overall system goals.

To properly engineer and exploit <span class="caps">CAS</span>, a deep scientific understanding of the principles underpinning their operation is required. The development of <span class="caps">CAS</span> is closely related to other contemporary (software) engineering approaches, such as component-based systems and middleware platforms, as well as other Computer Science areas, such as Distributed Artificial Intelligence, Formal Methods, Agent-based Programming, Pervasive Computing, Internet of Things, and Autonomic Computing. This track aims at providing a common forum for discussing the various different viewpoints over <span class="caps">CAS</span>, attracting relevant and consistent contributions from different research communities, with the ultimate goal of filling the gap between theory and practice, hence paving the way towards implementation of relevant applications.

The Special Track on Collective Adaptive Systems takes deliberately a broad view of what <span class="caps">CAS</span> are and how they should be designed, analysed, built and deployed. In particular, the track&#8217;s interest is both in the foundational view (e.g., theories, methods, formalisms, models) and the practical aspects (e.g., development methodologies, programming languages, middleware, development and runtime environments, tools). Moreover, also applications of <span class="caps">CAS</span> solutions to real-world case studies are welcomed.

Major topics of interest this year will include the following:
<ul>
<li>Novel models, languages, programming and implementation techniques for&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li><span class="caps">CAS</span> technologies and&nbsp;infrastructures</li>
    <li><span class="caps">CAS</span>&nbsp;applications</li>
    <li>Scenarios, case studies and experience reports of&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Formal aspects (semantics, reasoning, verification) in <span class="caps">CAS</span>&nbsp;development</li>
    <li>Business Processes in <span class="caps">CAS</span> - Self-* and emerging properties of&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Security and privacy in <span class="caps">CAS</span> - Policy-based coordination and self-adaptation in&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Middleware platforms for&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Software architectures and engineering methodologies for&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Proceedings</h3>
Papers accepted for the Special Track on Collective Adaptive Systems will be published by <span class="caps">ACM</span> both in the <span class="caps">SAC</span> 2017 proceedings and in the Digital Library.

<span class="caps">CAS</span> Special Track organisers also plan to invite authors of selected papers for a Special Issue in a high impact journal, such as <span class="caps">ACM</span> Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems or Science of Computer Programming.
<h3>Paper submission and&nbsp;format</h3>
All papers should represent original and previously unpublished works that currently are not under review in any conference or journal.

The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must <span class="caps">NOT</span> appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should be in the third person. This is to facilitate blind review. Only the title should be shown at the first page without the authors&#8217; information.

Submitted papers must be in the <span class="caps">ACM</span> two-column page format (doc template, pdf template, latex template). The length of the papers is 6 pages (included in the registration) plus up to 2 extra pages (at extra charge), i.e. total 8 pages maximum.

Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending <span class="caps">SAC</span> <span class="caps">MUST</span> present the paper: This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the <span class="caps">ACM</span>/<span class="caps">IEEE</span> digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the <span class="caps">ACM</span>/<span class="caps">IEEE</span> digital library.

Submission is entirely automated via the <span class="caps">STAR</span> Submission System, which is available from:
<ul>
<li>(for regular papers) <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.softconf.com/h/sac2017/">https://www.softconf.com/h/sac2017/</a>
</li>
    <li>(for <span class="caps">SRC</span> papers) <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.softconf.com/h/sac-src2017/">https://www.softconf.com/h/sac-src2017/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Poster&nbsp;Sessions</h3>
Papers that received high reviews (that is acceptable by reviewer standards) but were not accepted due to space limitation can be invited for the poster session. Poster should be not longer than 3 pages (included in the registration) plus 1 extra page (at extra charge), i.e. total 4 pages maximum. The poster session procedures and details will be posted on <span class="caps">SAC</span> 2017 website as soon as they become available.
<h3>Student research abstracts&nbsp;competition</h3>
Graduate students are invited to submit Student Research Competition (<span class="caps">SRC</span>) abstracts (maximum of 2 pages in <span class="caps">ACM</span> camera-ready format) following the instructions published at <span class="caps">SAC</span> 2017 website. Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers and practitioners with expertise in the track focus area to which they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts (up to 20 students) will have the opportunity to give poster and oral presentations of their work and compete for three top-winning places. The winners will receive medals, cash awards, and <span class="caps">SIGAPP</span> recognition certificates during the conference banquet. Invited students receive <span class="caps">SRC</span> travel support (<span class="caps">US</span>$500) and are eligible to apply to the <span class="caps">SIGAPP</span> Student Travel Award Program (<span class="caps">STAP</span>) for additional travel support.

	Jaron Lanier&nbsp;(2013)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A fascinating, if ultimately incomplete, exploration of the alternatives to the current web architecture that prioritises the needs of companies over those of consumers – or producers, if the truth be told. Lanier approaches the problems strictly from the perspective of information and information processing, with a clarity that I, even as a computer scientist, find refreshingly complete: it&#8217;s as though he&#8217;s willing to encompass some of the logical consequences that even professionals shy away from.<br><br>The central argument is that internet users, and especially users of social networks, are providing too much information for free to companies that then profit from it. Lanier suggests some alternative approaches to this, where content and expertise give rise to micro-payment compensation in cash or some other medium of exchange. The problem is that this is a tall order against the structures that have already grown up, and it&#8217;s unclear that it&#8217;s now possible to change tack as radically as would be required. Still, in many ways that makes this work all the more important, and it&#8217;s a great contribution to the broader literature on e-commerce and digital&nbsp;living.

	Ta-Nehisi Coates&nbsp;(2015)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A book that it&#8217;s perhaps hard for a white, middle-aged, Englishman to review, but still a powerful indictment of how America still relates to its black (and other) populations – made all the more poignant by the current spate of police shootings and the contentious presidential campaign that&#8217;s unmistakeably racist. Coates chooses to frame his argument in terms of physical threat, using it as both a metaphor and as an entrance to the more general sense of fear and danger still felt by many. He doesn&#8217;t avoid the changing face of oppression over the years, but still holds that there&#8217;s a danger to being black in America that it&#8217;s hard for whites (and non-Americans) to fully understand: perhaps the closest we can come to it in the <span class="caps">UK</span> would be the feelings of Catholics in Northern Ireland during the height of the Troubles, which was a story of privilege and discrimination that I remember being hard to accept at the&nbsp;time.

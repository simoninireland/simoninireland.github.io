      The history of Manifest Destiny written from the perspective of its victims.<br><br>This isn&#8217;t an easy read. The central characters are all doomed from the start by their weakness and lack of understanding of what is motivating their other side. However, what comes through clearly is both the nobility of the Native Americans in the face of their own destruction, but also the cruelty and capriciousness that led the new settlers to misunderstand their motivations and desires.<br><br>Stronger than this, though, is the Victorian hypocrisy of the settlers and weakness of the <span class="caps">US</span> government during the period. As soon as there&#8217;s any value perceived in Indian lands, treaties are torn up and &#8220;re-negotiated&#8221; to their detriment. These depredations are all accompanied by the most suffocating cant about what&#8217;s good for the tribes, or how much value they&#8217;ll obtain for giving up their &#8220;worthless&#8221; land. This is what makes the story resonate, for me. It&#8217;s not that the Native Americans were dispossessed of their lands: that&#8217;s normal practice in an invasion and, while possibly deplorable, is at least commonplace in history. What isn&#8217;t common is to assert, apparently sincerely on some people&#8217;s parts, that the dispossession is happening for the good of, or to the benefit of, the dispossessed. It shows the settlers as unable to conceive of the Indians as partners with whom one treats seriously &#8212; never mind as equals &#8212; and provides a fig leaf behind which to hide their direct or indirect destruction.<br><br>The government also comes through as weak, in the power of vested interests and cabals of plotters, and unable to enforce its decisions over space or time. The people on the ground almost always have a different perception &#8212; sometimes better, sometimes worse &#8212; of the situation, but the lack of control means that these perceptions are of no use in improving in the long term how the Native Americans are treated. Perhaps this was inevitable at the time: reading in our own time, however, it&#8217;s hard to think of the federal government being so helpless against the States or even its own agents.<br><br>I think the question of whether it was even conceivable that Indians and settlers could have lived together peacefully remains largely unanswered and subject to too many imponderables: <i>if</i> the Indians had been left enough reservations, <i>if</i> the central government could have prevented settlements from encroaching, <i>if</i> the railroads could have gone through without conflict, then perhaps. The fact that none of these approaches were ever tried with any seriousness does no credit to those involved either locally or&nbsp;nationally.

      A romp through the lesser-known facts of the periodic table. I think anyone with even a basic interest in science would find this book entertaining and at times fascinating. It has a broad spread that includes scientific facts, the processes of discovery, biography and human rivalry &#8212; often in the same paragraph.<br><br>I can&#8217;t say I like the author&#8217;s style, though: it&#8217;s too &#8220;bouncy&#8221;, too frantic to entertain, and the content is sufficiently absorbing not to need such a treatment. That&#8217;s purely a personal preference, of course, and another reader might find it&nbsp;exhilarating.

			<p>Something I said ten years ago comes back to not haunt me: in fact, I was quite pedestrian about the whole&nbsp;thing.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>My friend Rich was house-cleaning and came across an interview that I did with the Irish media about ten years ago, while we were running our company, Aurium. One thing really jumped out at him was the answer I gave to one particular&nbsp;question:</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will we be using to access the Internet 10 years from&nbsp;now?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll even think about it in those terms. It&#8217;s a bit like asking what sort of device you use to access the telephone network. In 10 years the internet will be so ubiquitous that we won&#8217;t even think about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><img alt="The interview" src="../images/posts/20130925-paper.jpg"></p>
<p>I remember giving this interview, and it feels weird in a number of ways. Firstly, when you see an &#8220;expert&#8221; being interviewed in a newspaper, don&#8217;t assume that he&#8217;s there because of his expertise. He could simply be a randomer with a good <span class="caps">PR</span> firm, which is what I was: the article was &#8220;placed&#8221; as part of our public relations campaign. Secondly, I was right in terms of where the technology was going, but that wasn&#8217;t due to any vision on my part: it was simply a function of being part of the development of that technology and seeing from the inside where it <em>could</em> go. There are plenty of alternative futures where things happened differently and the internet didn&#8217;t take off as it did. Had we had a major security crisis or breach of privacy in the first few years, that might have killed people&#8217;s confidence enough to damp-down the&nbsp;uptake.</p>
<p>What really struck me, though, was exactly how pervasive the technology <em>did</em> become. As it happens I&#8217;m in London on business with my colleague Graeme, and it&#8217;s instructive to look at all the things we did on the internet &#8212; and indeed from mobile gadgets. Firstly, I checked-in on the British Airways cellphone app and so didn&#8217;t need a printed boarding pass. (This is an application we first suggested ten years ago, incidentally: a boarding pass is just a token, so why not text someone a long number to identify themselves with?) Then we arrived not knowing where the hotel was, but a combination of the Tube Map app and <a href="http://maps.google.com" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> soon directed us <em>via</em> train and foot, from Gatwick airport to Pimlico. We looked up places to drink and a place for dinner the next day using <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a>, again navigating there with Google Maps, and made recommendations for the various places for other travellers. (Oh, and incidentally checked in for the return flight while sat in the pub &#8212; very civilised, I must say.) We found a coffee shop while we were waiting for our meeting, which itself took place in a venue whose location we also didn&#8217;t know relative to our hotel. I collected the different bookings and details in <a href="https://www.tripit.com/" target="_blank">TripIt</a>, which shared them into my Google Calendar so I didn&#8217;t have to take note of them. And I took some pictures and shared them on <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>But actually the most surprising thing isn&#8217;t the technology, or the mobile device, or the fact that it all actually works together in practice: it&#8217;s that <em>real people actually do it</em>, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m unique in using all this mobile internet technology when travelling. We pretty much take for granted the idea of finding our way in a new place without preparation: neither Graeme nor I ever even <em>thought</em> about how we&#8217;d find the hotel or the meeting venue beforehand, we just got up and did&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Looking back, I&#8217;m not surprised we (the technology community) got the technology to work; I&#8217;m not even really surprised at the availability of mobile internet and a load of apps to make use of it; but I must confess to being slightly surprised that at the acceptance of all the gadgetry amongst the general population, enough to generate an ecosystem of companies who work together and create more value from their interoperability. It&#8217;s something we always said would happen, but it&#8217;s quite strange to see it in operation, and it&#8217;s a positive achievement we shouldn&#8217;t forget&nbsp;about.</p>

      This is a fascinating book that somehow fails to satisfy. It consists of a series of biographical sketches &#8212; some short, some extended, of people and places &#8212; that catalogue the &#8220;unwinding&#8221; of America&#8217;s social contract over the decades since 1970: how the decline of well-paying, stable, blue-collars jobs and the rise of big-box retainers has destabilised society.<br><br>Some of the details are extraordinary, such as the evolution of a community activist in Youngstown, Ohio, in response to the collapse of local industry, or the travails of Tampa, Florida, in the face of a housing bubble. As a whole, however, the book doesn&#8217;t make its point very clearly. The addition of a descriptive or analytic conclusion might have helped, and indeed I was led to read the book by an interview with the author on Irish radio in which he provided exactly this additional&nbsp;analysis.

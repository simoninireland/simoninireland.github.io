      When complimented on his armies capturing Berlin at the end of the Second World War, Stalin famously replied that &#8220;Tsar Alexander made it to Paris.&#8221; This book describes how, and why, that happened – and why it meant to much to Stalin, on whom Sebag Montefirore is of course a recognised expert.<br><br>The sweep of Romanov history is epic in all senses. It&#8217;s impossible not to realise how deeply <i>personal</i> their rule was, identifying their own reigns absolutely with Russia and its greatness. The main characters are all flawed in tragic ways, sometimes grotesque but equally often brilliant and self-aware within the limitations of their eras – which none ever really managed to trascend, with the possible exception of Peter and later Catherine, each known as &#8220;the Great&#8221; for that reason.<br><br>The story is made powerful by recent research in the Russian archives and access to previously-unkown letters between Alexander <span class="caps">II</span> and his mistress, and later between Nicholas <span class="caps">II</span> and Alexandra. They highlight the impact of extra-marital affairs on high policy right across the Romonov era: it&#8217;s often hard to keep track of who is related to (or sleeping with) whom, or to understand the true importance of some of the less well-known characters in the story who may have have had an advisory impact far beyond what their &#8220;official&#8221; position might suggest.<br><br>It&#8217;s a book that&#8217;s hard on autocracy – but also quite hard on the alternatives that came after. Sebag Montefiore sees a continuity between the tsars, Lenin, Stalin, and Putin, and almost seems to regard it as inevitable that Russia will need strongman leadership. One can perhaps hope&nbsp;not.

      A thoughtful look at modelling by an experienced climate modeller.<br><br>What are models <i>for</i>? The most common answer would be &#8220;to predict the future behaviour of some system,&#8221; but Thompson argues a far more subtle line: that the most important models often <i>fail</i> to be predictive in any real sense. Much of this is down to problems of validation, especially in climate models for which we have no experience of the world the models are trying to predict.<br><br>An even more subtle mistake is regarding all models as &#8220;cameras&#8221; that simply observe the world. That&#8217;s true for the more abstract kinds of modelling, where one is trying to understand possible behaviours of systems in general without tying them to specific circumstances. But the models with which most people are familiar act ore like &#8220;engines&#8221; that can perturb the system they&#8217;re purporting simply to observe by baing used as drivers for policy. Climate and epidemic models seek to warn as well as predict and understand, but this exacerbates the problems of validation: if the model&#8217;s predictions <i>don&#8217;t</i> come to pass, perhaps this is because policy-makers took corrective actions in response, or maybe bacause they didn&#8217;t intervent effectively enough. This isn&#8217;t a reason to give up on modelling altogether: how else are we to understand complex systems, and how else are we to respond rationally to them? But it does mean that the notion of &#8220;following the science&#8221; problematic.<br><br>Thompson also wrestles with the problem of groupthink amongst modellers, who often share a common overallping background. I agree this is a problem, but the idea that we can increase diversity in the community easily seems flawed to me. Modellers share a scientific viewpoint and a belief in modelling, and no-one who doesn&#8217;t will ever be able to effectively engage with the models or their arguments. Perhaps it&#8217;s enough that scientists are always advisors and never decision-makers, and allow politicians to deal with the integration of different choices and values – although that split isn&#8217;t always appreciated by the public, and is often (as in the covid-19 pandemic) deliberately blurred to allow less-trusted politicians to draw credibility from more-trusted scientists and doctors.<br><br>Overall I think this is a lucid and valiant attempt to summarise and explore the benefits and limitations of models, and science in general, when it impacts directly on the wider world. It deserves to be widely read in the scientific community so that we can better understand our place in policies that we often unavoidably have to influence.<br><br></p>

An interview on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeveloperVoices">Developer Voices</a> podcast with <a href="https://www.schafmeistergroup.com/">Prof Christian
Schafmeister</a> on designing enzymes using a custom dialect of Lisp
to control computational chemistry&nbsp;libraries.
</p>

<p>
He initially started from an idea based on <span class="caps">CAD</span> applications
(written in Smalltalk), but rapidly realised there were too many
possible components and combinations to work with graphically and
so started treating it as a language-design problem – and
designed a custom Lisp based on <a href="https://ecl.common-lisp.dev/"><span class="caps">ECL</span></a>. Lisp provides simplicity and
efficiency, as well as being a &#8220;forever&#8221; language in which
software keeps working over the long&nbsp;term.

John McCarthy.  <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/960118.808386">A Micro-Manual for Lisp: Not the Whole Truth</a></i>. <span class="caps">ACM</span>
<span class="caps">SIGPLAN</span> Notices <b>13</b>, pp.215–216.&nbsp;1978.
</p>

<p>
A &#8220;manual&#8221; in the sense of providing a complete implementation of
Lisp – in Lisp&nbsp;itself.
</p>

<p>
Is that useful? A semantics expert would say &#8220;no&#8221;, since such a
model has no real explanatory power: the recursion doesn&#8217;t
bottom-out to define the concepts. However, a programming language
expert might disagree and observe that this is <i>meta-linguistic
abstraction</i>, the use of one high-level language to capture the
definition of another. The &#8220;host&#8221; language provides a higher level
of abstraction than is usual when writing interpreters and
compilers, so it becomes easier to experiment with different forms
of &#8220;target&#8221; language as there&#8217;s less low-level work to do. This
benefit exists even when host and target are the same: essentially
the target is bootstrapped and can then be adjusted while running
within an earlier version of&nbsp;itself.
</p>

<p>
As far as I know this is the first example of meta-linguistic
abstraction in the computer science literature. The idea was
popularised by <a href="/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/"><span class="caps">SICP</span></a> (using Scheme), and forms the basis for a lot
of modern bootstrapped&nbsp;compilers.

paper 79. <span class="caps">MIT</span> <span class="caps">AI</span> Laboratory.&nbsp;1974.
</p>

<p>
A description of the architecture later built and sold by&nbsp;<span class="caps">LMI</span>.
</p>

<p>
A visionary description of a machine to run Lisp at a
&#8220;non-prohibitive cost&#8221; of $70,000 per system. (The web tells me
that this is the equivalent of <a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1974?amount=70000">$440,000</a> in 2024.) A completely
integrated system based on a Cons processor and using a <span class="caps">PDP</span>-11 as
a console. A relocating, compacting, garbage collector with
invisible forwarding pointers. Non-linear spaghetti stacks to
support advanced programming&nbsp;constructs.
</p>

<p>
One of the many notable facets of this design is one of its
proposals (the &#8220;frame pushdown list&#8221;) to avoid excessive conses
and garbage collection overhead by maintaining lists of blocks of
particular sizes. It uses this approach to manage the creation of
call stack frames; modern Python implementations use this scheme
throughout to avoid heap fragmentation through allocating and
re-allocating blocks of different sizes. (Lisp has this feature
generally, of course, with its use of fixed-size cons&nbsp;cells.)
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s also fascinating to see that, even at this early stage,
hardware design was being seen as an exercise in refinement to
maintain software-level abstractions even as features were being
pushed into hardware – while still providing optimised
implementations that were invisible to the&nbsp;programmer.

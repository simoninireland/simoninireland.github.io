      A fabulous opening to a space opera that looks to combine political dynastic in-fighting with a complex physical universe. There are very visible shades of Florentine politics, as well as nods to other science fiction universes – neither of which in any way interfere with the novelty and pace of the&nbsp;narrative.

      An interesting review of surveillance, especially good on the history of private investigators as strikebreakers and blacklisters, both in the <span class="caps">US</span> (the Pinkertons) but also in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, which is a far less well-known&nbsp;story.

	Yanis Varoufakis&nbsp;(2017)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      An emotionally charged but very readable personal account of the third stage of the Greek financial crisis, as told by one of the protagonists.<br><br>It&#8217;s important to bear in mind that this is autobiography, not history, and as such can be excused for being polemical in Varoufakis&#8217; defence. It&#8217;s detailed and complex in its political overtones, but the core argument is very simple: the Greek financial crisis long ago ceased to be about economics and became a morality play in which the Greek state is forced to accept increasingly steep remedies that aren&#8217;t in any way intended to bring about a recovery, or even to recover monies already loaned.<br><br>One can&#8217;t treat the account as history, since so many of the exchanges are uncorroborated. Moreover, Varoufakis reduces his entire account of the run-up to very small sections – almost single sentences – where he admits that the Greek state had massively mismanaged its own economy. It&#8217;s acceptable for him to do so, both because he&#8217;s telling the story of his own involvement in events and because, quite frankly, the details are irrelevant to him <i>as an economist</i>. He sees a state that&#8217;s incapable of repaying its loans and expects capitalism to work as it should – by imposing the losses on those foolish enough to make the loans. When the opposite happens, and the lenders (European banks) are bailed-out at the expense of the Greek citizenry and European taxpayer, he&#8217;s almost at a loss to deal with the fact that the economics have become an irrelevance. <br><br>His account is eerily consistent with those dealing with the Irish &#8220;bailout&#8221; (which was, similarly, no such thing – not of the state receiving it, anyway). It will remain for future historians to weigh the different accounts in the balance, and this book will be one of their main&nbsp;sources.

	Yuval Noah Harari&nbsp;(2011)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A balanced and thoughtful history of humanity.<br><br>This is a wide-ranging book that often comes at familiar questions from different perspectives. Are humans causing rapid species extinctions in modern times? – yes, but it happened before as we spread into new regions and the local megafauna &#8220;coincidentally&#8221; disappeared. Have agriculture and science reduced human suffering? – yes, but at an enormous cost in animal suffering. And so on in a cascade of provocations that constantly raise questions and force judgements on the reader.<br><br>I think one can disagree somewhat with the trajectory of the arguments while agreeing with all the details. Harari maintains throughout that the ideas and philosophies we embrace today are just as transient and laking in foundation as any others. The transience is certainly true, of course, but I think one can be slightly more optimistic about the large-scale direction, and not be totally consumed by relativism.<br><br>The final two pages are perhaps the most insightful: <i>&#8220;Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don&#8217;t know what they want?&#8221;</i> The only conclusion In think we can draw from this book is that we&#8217;re <i>going</i> to be as gods, like it or not, and we&#8217;d better start deciding what we want to do with those powers: &#8220;what do we want to want&#8221;, in another of the author&#8217;s very insightful&nbsp;phrases.

      Space opera in a very different form. For a start, there are literally no men in the cast (universe). Secondly, the location and context of the story – giant world-sized spaceships closely orbiting a star and fighting amongst themselves – isn&#8217;t explained or in any way inferable. Reality never becomes clear, but that works really well to set this story apart and let the author&#8217;s quite astounding imagination run free without&nbsp;constraints.

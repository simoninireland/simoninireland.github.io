      An introduction to systems thinking for practitioners. This is a book that avoids all the mathematics of queues and games, while still drawing heavily on their influence and allowing those wanting to learn and apply systems thinking to gain an understanding of the main ideas.<br><br>There&#8217;s a huge need for more systems thinking. It boils down to understanding the way systems &#8220;flow&#8221;, with resources entering, being processed, and leaving. In doing so we find systems that can have several &#8220;steady&#8221; states, still operating at full capacity but not maintaining a regular and predictable behaviour. We also find that systems can switch very quickly from one stable state to another, perhaps less desirable, and it might not be as easy to get <i>out</i> of such a state as it was to get <i>in</i> to it: behavioural change can be difficult or impossible to reverse.<br><br>All these ideas have proper mathematical underpinnings. The great thing about this book is that it consumes and presents those underpinnings without ever actually referring to them. It treats systems theory as a machine that anyone can use: you might get more precise answers from a more scientific analysis, but eiven without this you can still apply the ideas intuitively to gain a better understanding of the world. I think it&#8217;s a distinctive addition to the literature on complex&nbsp;systems.

      Everyone associates mediæval manuscripts with monasteries and monks, but nuns had an enormous part to play as well, including in some of the best-known works. That&#8217;s the central observation of this extremely enjoyable book. It&#8217;s niche in the sense of really appealing to caligraphers and classicists, but it also serves to show (once again) that the Middle Ages (and before) were a socially richer period than we often imagine.<br><br>As well as Latin, we&#8217;re exposed to a lot of Old and Middle English, carefully translated and glossed to make the context comprehensible. I can imagine that experts might object to some of the modernisation, but for an non-specialist it was quite clarifying.<br><br>About the only negative point was that I suspect the book emerged from Mary Wellesley&#8217;s PhD thesis – and that sometimes shows in places where she feels the need to justify herself vaery carefully against the existing literature. None of that spoils the readability and insightfulness,&nbsp;though.

      I often avoid books like these, as I worry that they&#8217;ll focus on a single aspect of the environment and try too hard to make it all-consumingly special. This isn&#8217;t a book like that. Perhaps because it&#8217;s written by a scientist, it&#8217;s balanced and carefully supported. It covers all the parts of fungi you&#8217;d expect, in all their strangeness: we talk of things being &#8220;animal, vegetable, or mineral&#8221; and ignore the fourth possibility (although we should perhaps also include bacteria, archæa, and viruses too).<br><br>The &#8220;wood wide web&#8221; of communications between trees mediated by fungi gets an excellent treatment, both its mechanics and in terms of how evolution might have brought it about by allowing co-operation to complement individual competition (shades of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22565080.Peter_Kropotkin" title="Peter Kropotkin" rel="nofollow noopener">Peter Kropotkin</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1310303.Mutual_Aid_A_Factor_of_Evolution" title="Mutual Aid A Factor of Evolution by Peter Kropotkin" rel="nofollow noopener">Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution</a>). There&#8217;s also extensive consideration of the psychotropic effects of fungi and the chemicals they produce, both on humans (which can be pleasant) and insects (which can be <i>far</i> worse). And there is also the far-less-known ability of fungi to act as decontaminators to break down chemicals that are otherwise extremely difficult to deal with and lethal to most plants – and even more remarkably, that this ability seems to be amenable to being trained or at least steered in useful new directions.<br><br>I have to admire Sheldrake&#8217;s creativity and perseverance in studying fungi. They&#8217;re clearly a hard topic to research, not least because the fruiting bodies are only a visible clue to a far larger and more diffuse underground body that&#8217;s a challenge to detect, let alone sense or&nbsp;explore.

      A study of the compromises needed to live in a totalitarian society, and the difficulties this causes for anyone wanting to operate there.<br><br>The simple view of an oppressive regime is that everyone is ground down and cowed by the corrupted police and courts, But <i>some</i> people always manage to succeed, and even more manage to soften the edges of the system by acts of kindness and rememberance. This book is about the latter group, and how they manage to keep some pieces of a gentler vision alive.<br><br>Yaffa knows Russia well, and understands the arbitrariness of it: it&#8217;s never entirely clear what is permitted and what is forbidden, and even the written rules provide little guide. He observes that people manage to find the edges of what the authorities will permit, and stay within within them voluntarily – meaning that the actual application of oppression or terror become less necessary as time goes by and people self-censor.<br><br>Along the way he meets several people who are doing just that. Perhaps the most interesting are the lady providing health services in conflict zones, which she manages only with the co-operation of the State – who can therefore claim some credit and whitewash their own behaviour by pointing to her humanitarian activities. Or the founders of a museum to the Gulag, who are driven out of their leadership positions and replaced by someone who better understands the authorities&#8217; goal for the museum, subverting its message without actually closing it down.<br><br>It&#8217;s hard to know what to think about these actions. On the one hand, one might hope for a more forceful and uncomprimised rebellion against oppression; on the other, such a rebellion would need to be widespread to stand any chance of success, and the individual costs would be horrific. Perhaps the situation that Russians have arrived at is good for now, while they wait for the winds to change in a more liberal direction. They could have a long time to&nbsp;wait.

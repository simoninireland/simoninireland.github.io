It does this, although as a sequel it&#8217;s far less impactful than the original, and seems to spend too much time on the historical progression of the chosen countries and not enough on the ways these histories actually manifest the geographical constraints under which they&#8217;re constrained. Indeed, some of the countries&#8217; geographies (such as Saudi Arabia&#8217;s) seem almost irrelevant compared to their geologies.<br><br>The inclusion of &#8220;space&#8221; as a country is interesting from a political perspective, and Marshall does manage to show that it has a &#8220;geography&#8221; of sorts – as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31528889.Robert_Heinlein" title="Robert Heinlein" rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Heinlein</a> is quoted as saying, once you&#8217;re in Earth orbit you&#8217;re halfway to anywhere, since getting up the gravity well is the major transport cost. I&#8217;m assuming this will be the subject of a later&nbsp;book.

      An introduction to systems thinking for practitioners. This is a book that avoids all the mathematics of queues and games, while still drawing heavily on their influence and allowing those wanting to learn and apply systems thinking to gain an understanding of the main ideas.<br><br>There&#8217;s a huge need for more systems thinking. It boils down to understanding the way systems &#8220;flow&#8221;, with resources entering, being processed, and leaving. In doing so we find systems that can have several &#8220;steady&#8221; states, still operating at full capacity but not maintaining a regular and predictable behaviour. We also find that systems can switch very quickly from one stable state to another, perhaps less desirable, and it might not be as easy to get <i>out</i> of such a state as it was to get <i>in</i> to it: behavioural change can be difficult or impossible to reverse.<br><br>All these ideas have proper mathematical underpinnings. The great thing about this book is that it consumes and presents those underpinnings without ever actually referring to them. It treats systems theory as a machine that anyone can use: you might get more precise answers from a more scientific analysis, but eiven without this you can still apply the ideas intuitively to gain a better understanding of the world. I think it&#8217;s a distinctive addition to the literature on complex&nbsp;systems.

    <p>
      Everyone associates mediæval manuscripts with monasteries and monks, but nuns had an enormous part to play as well, including in some of the best-known works. That&#8217;s the central observation of this extremely enjoyable book. It&#8217;s niche in the sense of really appealing to caligraphers and classicists, but it also serves to show (once again) that the Middle Ages (and before) were a socially richer period than we often imagine.<br><br>As well as Latin, we&#8217;re exposed to a lot of Old and Middle English, carefully translated and glossed to make the context comprehensible. I can imagine that experts might object to some of the modernisation, but for an non-specialist it was quite clarifying.<br><br>About the only negative point was that I suspect the book emerged from Mary Wellesley&#8217;s PhD thesis – and that sometimes shows in places where she feels the need to justify herself vaery carefully against the existing literature. None of that spoils the readability and insightfulness,&nbsp;though.

      I often avoid books like these, as I worry that they&#8217;ll focus on a single aspect of the environment and try too hard to make it all-consumingly special. This isn&#8217;t a book like that. Perhaps because it&#8217;s written by a scientist, it&#8217;s balanced and carefully supported. It covers all the parts of fungi you&#8217;d expect, in all their strangeness: we talk of things being &#8220;animal, vegetable, or mineral&#8221; and ignore the fourth possibility (although we should perhaps also include bacteria, archæa, and viruses too).<br><br>The &#8220;wood wide web&#8221; of communications between trees mediated by fungi gets an excellent treatment, both its mechanics and in terms of how evolution might have brought it about by allowing co-operation to complement individual competition (shades of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22565080.Peter_Kropotkin" title="Peter Kropotkin" rel="nofollow noopener">Peter Kropotkin</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1310303.Mutual_Aid_A_Factor_of_Evolution" title="Mutual Aid A Factor of Evolution by Peter Kropotkin" rel="nofollow noopener">Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution</a>). There&#8217;s also extensive consideration of the psychotropic effects of fungi and the chemicals they produce, both on humans (which can be pleasant) and insects (which can be <i>far</i> worse). And there is also the far-less-known ability of fungi to act as decontaminators to break down chemicals that are otherwise extremely difficult to deal with and lethal to most plants – and even more remarkably, that this ability seems to be amenable to being trained or at least steered in useful new directions.<br><br>I have to admire Sheldrake&#8217;s creativity and perseverance in studying fungi. They&#8217;re clearly a hard topic to research, not least because the fruiting bodies are only a visible clue to a far larger and more diffuse underground body that&#8217;s a challenge to detect, let alone sense or&nbsp;explore.

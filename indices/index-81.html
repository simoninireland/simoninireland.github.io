	Marie-Jose Gransard&nbsp;(2016)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A book full of anecdotes and charm, describing how a huge cast of characters have interacted with <i>La Serenissima</i> over the centuries. On the way, Gransard highlights the unique characteristics of Venice: its loose morals and easygoing charm, but also its mystery and romance, its associations with love and lust and death. Best read in conjunction with a visit, I think (as I read it), when one an follow in some character&#8217;s footsteps to visit places perhaps not highlighted in the modern&nbsp;guidebooks.

	Michael  Wolff&nbsp;(2018)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      What can one say about a journey to the centre of the most disruptive and controversial White House of modern times? That is happened at all is amazing: that this book gives such a clear and (I would say) generally reasonably balanced view makes it a major contribution to political literature.<br><br>Wolff describes an administration at war with itself, a medieval court in which factions form and dissipate while seeking the attention of the monarch – and truly there&#8217;s no other way to describe Donald Trump, who sits at the centre of the book while remaining curiously absent as an individual. Trump comes across as a bundle of contradictions: an outsider who took on the system and won, but someone pathologically requiring attention and submission from all around him while simultaneously hating those who engage in this behaviour; someone unable to control his attention of impulses at the most basic level; someone who personalises everything, seeing every interaction as a zero-sum game in another&#8217;s gain must be his loss; and who is managing the presidency through, and for the benefit of, his own family.<br><br>It&#8217;s clear that Wolff thinks Trump is uniquely unsuited to the role of president, and is surrounded by staff who&#8217;s main task is to offer protection in both directions: protecting Trump from the world, but equally protecting the world from Trump. It&#8217;s also clear, I think, that Wolff&#8217;s Trump is suffering from dementia.<br><br>The book is marred by its writing style. There are rambling and often too-detailed sub-clauses – usually within hyphens – that often make sentences appalling difficult to read. And there are some jarring word uses (&#8220;hortatory&#8221;? really?) that add nothing and give the impression of someone trying too hard in places. Still, it&#8217;s a compelling read, both as history and warning.<br></p>

    <p>
      An anthology that rally gives a taste of the island. Robert Crawford (my colleague at St Andrews) is . talented poet in his own right, and he provides marvellously accessible translations of many of the poems associated with St Columba. These, coupled with several short stories set wholly or in part on Iona – and even an essay by another of my colleagues, Al Dearle, about the difficulties of providing internet access in wild parts – make this a book to dip into for inspiration and relief from &#8220;normal&#8221;&nbsp;life.

	Olivia Laing&nbsp;(2016)
      </h2>

    <p>
      A study of loneliness through the medium of several different artists, and the author&#8217;s discovery and reaction to them. Some of these artists are well-known, in name if not in the detail of their lives: Andy Warhol, Edward Hopper, Billie Holliday, and even to a lesser extent Valeri Solanas (who shot Warhol). Others were unknown to me: David Wojnarowicz and (especially) Henry Darger.<br><br>I&#8217;m not convinced that the studies of these artists – fascinating though they are – casts much light either on the author&#8217;s travails or on loneliness more broadly. The first part of the book is stronger in this respect, with a quite penetrating analysis of the difference between loneliness and solitude, and the virtues (for some) of being alone. It&#8217;s something every introvert can identify with. I was left with the feeling of a chapter missing, the need to draw all the strings of art and reflection&nbsp;together.

      A history of the longest battle of the First World War – or is it? The events of the actual battle get remarkably little space or discussion. Instead the book deals with the social history of the soldiers on both sides (although primarily the French), and on the various traps of attrition, prestige, and inertia that the generals and their political masters fell into. This is fascinating stuff, but there&#8217;s an unspoken assumption that the reader is primarily interested in these broader issues, and furthermore already knows all the important features of the battle itself in enough detail to not need even a chronology. Having read the book I still don&#8217;t know how the battle ended. It&#8217;s probably better therefore to think about this book as an exploration of the wider landscape, both official and personal, of the experience of a huge and extended battle, rather than having all that much to do with the battle as an&nbsp;event.

<a href="https://malisper.me/debugging-lisp-part-1-recompilation/">Debugging&nbsp;Lisp</a>
</p>

<p>
A four-part blog post series on debugging Lisp,&nbsp;covering:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Live recompilation of code from inside a debugging session,
together with re-executing changed code from within a running
stack&nbsp;trace</li>
<li>Inspecting objects and interacting with traces of function&nbsp;calls</li>
<li>Redefining classes, and how to ensure that existing instances
are upgraded to be compatible with the new&nbsp;definition</li>
<li>Restarts, the neglected part of the condition system that
controls how programs continue after encountering&nbsp;errors</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first two are essential, and show how <i>different</i> Lisp
programming is from using other languages. In fact it requires a
considerable mental shift to re-acquire the right reflexes for
dealing with errors and debugging in a fully interactive
environment: well, it did for me, anyway. We&#8217;re not used to
interactivity in large development environments. There is seldom
any need to close down a running Lisp session and start again, as
everything can usually be changed and adapted within a session.
This is very unlike the usual compile-edit-debug cycles we&#8217;ve
become accustomed&nbsp;to.
</p>

<p>
The third post – on redefining classes – shows how one can
upgrade a program that simply <i>has</i> to keep running, because its
live state upgrade can be programmed&nbsp;too.
</p>

<p>
The most significant part of the mental shift is to realise that
the debugger is written in Lisp itself, and makes use of restarts
and other features to provide the interface. This is a consequence
of the degree of exposure of the Lisp run-time structures into to
language itself, where they can be examined and manipulated using
the full power of the language – and then be re-started or
discarded as&nbsp;required.

      Food <i>versus</i> food-shaped industrial products.<br><br>Ultra-processed food (<span class="caps">UPF</span>) is pervasive in modern diets, and with it comes a litany of actual, conjectured, and supposed harms. <span class="caps">UPF</span> itself is a strange beast, taking food crops and turning them into pure components that can then be re-mixed to construct new products. This has some perverse consequences, such as flavours being removed from purified and &#8220;modified&#8221; oils and starches in order to make them more broadly usable – and then having <i>those same flavours</i> re-introduced later in the process, again in &#8220;modified&#8221; form. That sounds insane – how can it be cheaper than using the original oil? – but in fact it makes perfet commercial sense for companies wanting fungible raw materials to produce unvarying, known-ahead-of-time tastes and textures. <br><br>The resulting products (I&#8217;m now reluctant to call them foods), being created in labs, can be re-worked in pursuit of particular commercial goals, for example by adding powdered soya when looking to create a &#8220;high-protein&#8221; snack. They can also be re-engineered to be far more pleasurable and addictive for consumers, for example by hacking the body&#8217;s responses to food (which are themselves coming to be understood as far more subtle and complicated than we used to think).<br><br>van Tulleken has a science background, and it shows in the writing: most of the claims are carefully framed and evidenced. His background also saves him from falling for the industry&#8217;s faux-refutations about there not being definitive causal links to specific harms: randomised controlled trials <i>aren&#8217;t</i> the &#8220;scientific gold standard&#8221; in situations where they&#8217;re impossible to conduct in the real world, and epidemiological evidence coupled with some knowledge of the possible harm pathways can provide sufficient evidence. Having said that, he does sometimes deviate from this careful path, and there are a few instances of words like &#8220;may&#8221; and &#8220;could&#8221; doing a lot of heavy lifting.<br><br>One of the most powerful elements of the book is that it simultaneously doesn&#8217;t preach or prescribe, but does offer suggestions for ways forward. <span class="caps">UPF</span> is very difficult to precisely define, and is therefore difficult to legislate for or avoid. Does a single stabiliser in a product render it <span class="caps">UPF</span>? – because if so literally <i>anything in a packet</i> would be included. van Tulleken also takes aim at some of the wider social drivers of <span class="caps">UPF</span>, notably its cheapness and ease of preparation compared to &#8220;real&#8221; food, reinforcing poor diet as a consequence of poverty. He also suggests some interesting policy options, while also taking aim at a policy infrastructure that&#8217;s heavily co-opted by the <span class="caps">UPF</span> industry. Regulators and the food industry are <i>not</i> partners and have goals that are mutually irreconcilable within the current framework of pre-eminent shareholder&nbsp;value.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e6b1bc">
<p>
I recently had a use case where I wanted to associate a constant
value with a class <i>and</i> its instances – but I needed to be able to
get the value without having an instance to hand. This turns out
to be solvable in&nbsp;<span class="caps">CLOS</span>.
</p>

<p>
In languages like Java you can associate class variables with
classes, which can then be accessed without having an instance of
the class. <span class="caps">CLOS</span> also has class-allocated slots, for&nbsp;example:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">    </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defclass</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">A</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">instance-slot</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="ss">:initform</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">       </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">class-slot</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="ss">:allocation</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">:class</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="ss">:initform</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:documentation</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">"A class with instance- and class-allocated slots."</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
An instance&nbsp;of <code>A</code> has two&nbsp;slots: <code>instance-slot</code> stored per-instance,&nbsp;and <code>class-slot</code> stored only once and shared amongst all instances.
This is close to Java&#8217;s notion of class variables, but one still
needs an instance against which to call the method. (Seibel makes
this point in <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/object-reorientation-classes">chapter 17 of &#8220;Practical Common Lisp&#8221;</a>.)
</p>

<p>
One could just create a basic object and retrieve the&nbsp;slot:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">slot-value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">make-instance</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">'A</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">'class-slot</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
but that&#8217;s inelegant and could potentially trigger a lot of
unnecessary execution (and errors) if there are constructors&nbsp;(overridden <code>initialize-instance</code> methods)&nbsp;for <code>A</code>. One could use the
metaobject protocol to introspect on the slot, but that&#8217;s quite
involved and still allows the slot to be changed, which isn&#8217;t part
of this use&nbsp;case.
</p>

<p>
What I really want is to be able to define a generic function such&nbsp;as <code>class-slot</code> – but specialised against the <i>class</i> <code>A</code> rather than
against the <i>instances</i>&nbsp;of <code>A</code>. I thought this would need a metaclass
to define the method on, but it turned out that generic functions
are powerful enough on their&nbsp;own.
</p>

<p>
The trick is to first define a generic&nbsp;method:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">    </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defgeneric</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">class-slot</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">classname</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="s">"Access the class slot on class."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
As the argument name suggests, we&#8217;re planning on passing a class
name to this method, not an instance. To set the value&nbsp;for <code>A</code>, we
specialise the method as working on exactly the class&nbsp;A:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">    </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defmethod</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">class-slot</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">classname</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">eql</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">'A</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The <code>eql</code> specialiser selects this method only when exactly this
object is passed in – that is to say, the name&nbsp;of <code>A</code>.
</p>

<p>
But what if we have an <i>instance</i>&nbsp;of <code>A</code>? The same generic function
can still be used, but instead we specialise it against objects
of&nbsp;class <code>A</code> in the usual&nbsp;way:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">    </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defmethod</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">class-slot</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">A</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">class-slot</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">class-name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">class-of</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
If we now pass an instance&nbsp;of <code>A</code>, we extract its class name and then
re-call the <i>same</i> generic function, passing it the class name
instead of the object itself (which it doesn&#8217;t need, because the
slot value is independent of the actual object). This will select
the correct specialisation and return the slot&nbsp;value.
</p>

<p>
This approach works if we generate sub-classes&nbsp;of <code>A</code>: we just&nbsp;use
<code>eql</code> to specialise the generic function to the class we&#8217;re
interested in. It also works fine with packages, since the
undecorated symbol passed to the specialiser will be expanded
correctly according to what symbols are in scope. However, the
value is <i>only</i> associated with a single class, and isn&#8217;t inherited.
That&#8217;s not a massive limitation for my current use case, but would
be in general, I&nbsp;think.
</p>

<p>
This approach critically relies on an easily-forgotten property of
Lisp: <i>values</i> have types, but <i>variables</i> don&#8217;t, and we can
specialise the <i>same</i> generic function against <i>any</i> value <i>or</i> type.
The pattern makes use of this to avoid actually storing the value&nbsp;of <code>class-slot</code> anywhere, which as a side effect avoids the problem
of someone accidentally assigning a new value to it. It&#8217;s an
example of how powerful generic functions are: more so than the
method tables and messages found in most O-O languages. And it&#8217;s
sufficiently structured that it&#8217;s crying-out for a couple of
macros to define these kinds of class&nbsp;slots.
</p>

<p>
<span class="caps">UPDATED</span> 2024-06-29: Fixed the typo in the class definition to&nbsp;use
<code>:initform</code> and&nbsp;not <code>:initarg</code>. Thanks to <a href="https://framapiaf.org/@vindarel">@vindarel</a> for pointing this
out to&nbsp;me.

      A history of cybersecurity with an emphasis on attacks against critical infrastructure.<br><br>Rather than bomb a power plant or dam, why not have its own <span class="caps">IT</span> systems turn on it? That&#8217;s the premise of a lot of modern cyberattacks, and they can be run with all the same sophistication as more conventional attacks against purely digital targets – but with the proviso that a lot of the targets don&#8217;t think of themselves as <span class="caps">IT</span> organisations and haven&#8217;t interalised the importance of their digital control systems. Since they don&#8217;t emphasise security at board level, it gets neglected and becomes a weak spot that can be exploited from anywhere on the globe.<br><br>The remedies aren&#8217;t always trivial. Many attacks detailed in this book are almost incredibly elongated, involving the compromise of several servers and softwate packages on the way to the target. Keeping industrial control systems up-to-date can be difficult (or impossible): physical infrastructure exists on far longer timescales than the digital systems than control it. (I&#8217;ve had personal experience of laboratory equipment with control software that can <i>only</i> run on Windows 95, which isn&#8217;t being upgraded. Keeping that secure needs dedicated changes in the network architecture, and has a lot of knock-on consequences for efficiency and data management.)<br><br>The value of such hacking for criminals is easy to understand, but it&#8217;s also the ultimate technique of asymmetric warefare, letting an attacker deny responsibility and avoid counterattacks. Even the most powerful countries have an incentive to stop responses going kinetic, after all. But the asymmetry works both ways, with the <span class="caps">US</span> as one of the primary developers of sophisticated cyberweapons and so having an incentive not to push for international controls even while at the same time the <span class="caps">US</span> critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than others&#8217; to those weapons.<br><br>Greenberg is a long-time student of cyberwarfare, and writes with a lot of insight into both the politics and the technology. He highlights the impacts of many short-sighted decisions made in the interests of national security advantage, culminating in the Shadow Brokers&#8217; release of a cache of <span class="caps">NSA</span> tools that form the basis for a new generation of cyberweapons. This is a great book to pair with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247043.This_Is_How_They_Tell_Me_the_World_Ends_The_Cyberweapons_Arms_Race" title="This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends The Cyberweapons Arms Race by Nicole Perlroth" rel="nofollow noopener">This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race</a> for a broad-ranging and highly technically literate exploration of the new arms&nbsp;frontier.

<p>
Following on from <a href="/2024/06/14/lisp-macros-versus-rust-macros/">Lisp macros versus Rust macros</a>, I also want to
compare C++ templates to Lisp&nbsp;macros.
</p>

<p>
Templates in C++ were designed as a way of generating typed versions
of classes. The template declares some type variables that can be
used as placeholders within a class declaration. When the template
is instanciated and provided with actual type names, these are
substituted for the type variables and the class is expanded. (It
used to literally happen like this, so each use generated a
completely new class. Modern compilers are smart enough to avoid the
code repetition.) A classic example is a typed singly-linked&nbsp;list:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">  </span><span class="k">template</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">A</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">A</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">next</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
However, the template system also allows values to be used in
templates instead of (or as well as) type names. When these are
encountered they are expanded at compile-time, and may cause further
templates to be expanded. A classic example of this is to
pre-compute some&nbsp;factorials:
</p>

In this code the first clause defines a template that defines the
usual recursive factorial calculation. The second clause bottoms-out
this recursion by defining a specialised template that directly
provides the factorial of zero. This can then be used in code such&nbsp;as:

<p>
which outputs the factorial of 7 as one might expect – but with the
factorial having been computed at compile-time and inserted into the
code as a literal, so the calculation introduces no run-time&nbsp;calculation.
</p>

<p>
There are some stringent limitations on the ways in which templates
can be expanded. They can&#8217;t have mutable variables for a start
(that&#8217;s why we needed to use the recursive factorial algorithm).
Weirdly this makes the template language a <i>functional programming
sub-set</i> of C++. Having said that, as with Lisp macros, it allows
calculations that can be statically performed forward to be brought
forward to compile-time. This makes it useful for building read-only
tables, unrolling loops, and the&nbsp;like.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming#Benefits_and_drawbacks_of_template_metaprogramming">claimed</a> that templates are now so akin to &#8220;normal&#8221; C++ that
they incur less of a readability penalty. That&#8217;s a subjective
statement that may be true. But the template language <i>isn&#8217;t</i> C++.
While one <i>can</i> write programs in it, they&#8217;re <i>nothing like</i> the C++ one
would normally write. The template language is Turing complete, but
that just means one can encode any <i>computation</i>, not that one can
encode any <i>particular program</i> – and most template programs will
require massive re-writing from the code one would write normally
for execution at run-time. Template macroprogramming is therefore a
non-trivial programming task to&nbsp;undertake.
</p>

<p>
Again as with Rust <i>versus</i> Lisp, C++ templates are an extension to
the language rather than a core part of it, although they&#8217;re now
used quite extensively in the standard library for generic typing.
Also as with Rust, use of templates is semantically and
syntactically distinct from &#8220;normal&#8221; C++ code or syntax, and it&#8217;s
this that causes the programming&nbsp;load.
</p>

<p>
A Lisp macro for the factorial computation, by contrast, looks
<i>almost exactly</i> like a normal factorial function that can access the
entire language, both when defined and when&nbsp;used:

<p>
The choice of macro or function&nbsp;(<code>defmacro</code> or <code>defun</code>) has no further
<i>syntactic</i> implications for the rest of the program, and no
restrictions on the code that can be used within the definition; we
could re-write the to use iteration, mutable variables, or any other
code, and it would simply be executed at compile-time. The whole
language is there, all the time. We can show this by taking a
factorial function written in &#8220;normal&#8221; Lisp and macro-ifying it to
be computed at&nbsp;compile-time:

More importantly, Lisp (and indeed Rust) macro can abstract over
syntax as well as classes and values, and so allow the language to
be extended with new first-class-at-compile-time structures.
Templates are restricted to instanciating templates written with
a fixed syntax; in Lisp the syntax has to be &#8220;Lisp-like&#8221;, although
that&#8217;s a very light restriction; and in Rust a macro can use any
syntax that Rust can&nbsp;tokenise.
</p>

<p>
While C++ templates are sometimes described as macroprogramming (or
metaprogramming), they&#8217;re addressing a substantially different use
case to that addressed by Lisp or Rust macros, and doing so within a
more restricted computational and syntactic&nbsp;envelope.

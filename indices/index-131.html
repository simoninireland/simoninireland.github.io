      A history of books and reading.<br><br>This is a deep and cleverly-constructed history, running from the invention of papyrus scrolls to their replacement by parchment (and later paper) books. The transition away from papyrus brought with it a huge increase in comvenience – but also in the longevity of works, in that the physical stability and portability of books made it less likely that all copies of a work would disappear. Manuscripts needed to be physically copied to create another copy that might survive independently of the original; scrolls needed to be copied because they otherwise disintegrate.<br><br>Equally fascinating is the way books formed a central part of culture in the ancient world. I was particularly intrigued by the discussion of Roman libraries built in two rooms, one for the Latin and one for the Greek, and how the Romans saw and took up the challenges of Greek civilisation as a partial model (and counter-model) for their own. The centrality of literature to that endeavour is easy to overlook in more martial histories of Rome. <br><br>It's also interesting to see the ways in which things now commonplace were once technological innovations – such as tables of contents, library catalogues, punctuation, and the like. These were shaped by the capabilities <i>and</i> limitations of scrolls as a storage medium, and have persisted functionally unchanged down to the present day.

It does this, although as a sequel it's far less impactful than the original, and seems to spend too much time on the historical progression of the chosen countries and not enough on the ways these histories actually manifest the geographical constraints under which they're constrained. Indeed, some of the countries' geographies (such as Saudi Arabia's) seem almost irrelevant compared to their geologies.<br><br>The inclusion of "space" as a country is interesting from a political perspective, and Marshall does manage to show that it has a "geography" of sorts – as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31528889.Robert_Heinlein" title="Robert Heinlein" rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Heinlein</a> is quoted as saying, once you're in Earth orbit you're halfway to anywhere, since getting up the gravity well is the major transport cost. I'm assuming this will be the subject of a later book.

      A look at the BBC Micro through a very academic prism: I've never seen some popular games dissected or considered as topics for post-modern readings! In this sense it's a very different treatment to the more common histories of computers from this era, and one that I suspect for most people will be a lot less satisfying.

I don't think it holds together as well as its predecessor, and there's none of the pace or surprise that made the earlier book so enjoyable. It might make good material for a further TV adaptation, though.

      An interesting romp through the lesser-known areas of typography, literature, and language. The author manages to touch on an impressive breadth of content in a book ostensibly about punctuation, perhaps illustrating how language really does affect more of human activity than we might think.<br><br>I especially enjoyed the digressions into the emergence of pounds, shillings, and pence (as well as the pound sign). Many characters are treated in enormous detail: the history of the ampersand, for example, which walks the reader through a couple of millennia of language evolution. The hash sign and the interrobang also get star treatment, while the humble dash turns out to have more complexity than even this dedicated <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">LaTeX</a> user was expecting.<br></p>

      The blurb on the cover describes the protagonist as &#8220;the most fascinating detective in the history of crime fiction,&#8221; which is itself an overstatement of almost criminal proportions.<br><br>The story revolves around a criminal case with problematic evidence. So far, so ordinary. The characters however are without exception stereotypes. Even though the main character, Ash Rashid, is given colour by being a Muslim in the American mid-West, he&#8217;s a stereotypical Muslim: struggling with drink, worrying about missed prayers, staunchly supported by a more observant wife, and so forth. Along the way we meet the decent-but-too-hard prosecutor, the scheming crime boss who helps justice while pursuing his own agenda, the self-interested politician &#8212; should I go&nbsp;on?

      I may be being a bit harsh on this book, which makes a decent attempt at filling in the social history of one of the greatest contributors to wartime victory: but it felt like it missed almost all the excitement and significance of Bletchley Park and failed to really dig into the characters of those involved, despite extensive interviews. At the very least it might motivate one to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150731.Alan_Turing_The_Enigma" title="Alan Turing The Enigma by Andrew Hodges" rel="nofollow noopener">Alan Turing: The Enigma</a> or one of the other histories or memoires that have come out in the past few&nbsp;years.

		</div>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Happy 2014! We&#8217;re particularly happy to be making the first release of the SleepySketch library for writing low-power Arduino sketches.

<!--more-->

SleepySketch changes the way you write Arduino sketches by letting the library, rather than the main body of the sketch, decide when to run code. The sketch stays asleep as much as possible, with the Arduino placed into a low-power state to preserve battery.

This is a first release of SleepySketch, for comments. It provides a sketch framework, a basic sleep manager, and an example &#8220;blinkenlights&#8221; demonstration to show how the system fits together. Future releases will provide more flexible sleep management and support for component-level power management for common components like Xbee radios.

You can download SleepySketch v. 0.1 from <a href="../download/sleepysketch/">here</a>.

	Jacob Bronowski&nbsp;(1973)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Often described as one of the classics of our times, this is a book of essays charting the various stages in the author&#8217;s conception of the intellectual evolution of humanity. In a sense it should be compared to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/330451.Civilisation" title="Civilisation by Kenneth Clark" rel="nofollow noopener">Civilisation</a>, Kenneth Clarke&#8217;s history of art: a personal selection of important events.<br><br>Bronowski&#8217;s is a selection few would argue with, but he adds interest through his own personal acquaintanceship with some of the characters involved: Einstein, Born, and (most interestingly) von Neumann. His take on early history had probably been overtaken by some of modern anthropology, but his analysis of the industrial revolution is fascinating, as is his central thesis that the main agent of progress is simply the desire of the craftsman to improve his craft, beyond any real pressure for improvement coming from&nbsp;outside.

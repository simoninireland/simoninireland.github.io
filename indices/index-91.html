      Quite an astonishing book, combining science fiction with social commentary and Chinese history in a seamless and rather stunning way.<br><br>This book has some really quite visionary passages, drawing deeply on cultural history and the farther reaches of mathematical physics. It also has some resonances from the <span class="caps">SF</span> classics, especially (and perhaps surprisingly) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21611.The_Forever_War__The_Forever_War___1_" title="The Forever War (The Forever War, #1) by Joe Haldeman" rel="nofollow noopener">The Forever War</a>, with its central problem of how to fight a war in the face of travel times long enough to render your weaponry obsolete? Liu&#8217;s solution is brilliant: find a way to stall your enemy&#8217;s scientific progress, using both scientific and social weapons, with the latter also having eerie resonances in modern social-media commentaries. An excellent and thought-provoking start to a&nbsp;trilogy.

      A history of Nazi Germany from the different perspective of the first tier of Hitler&#8217;s followers, mainly focussing on Goebbels, Goering, and Himmler. That&#8217;s actually a slight limitation, in that there are huge contributions from other, second-tier Nazis that remain to be explored, and that might have made this book even more distinctive. But it still manages to put a lot of detail into the personal lives and deeds of its chosen subjects which are often missed in more &#8220;standard&#8221; histories, and this sheds a lot of light onto many of their motivations and key decisions. A very useful addition to the&nbsp;literature.

      A detailed history of the Manchester Ship Canal, lavishly illustrated from across the years.<br><br>I grew up alongside the canal, and there&#8217;s plenty here I didn&#8217;t know. It would have been better to have more depth in a lot of places, especially in terms of construction techniques and the history of some of the areas such as Old Quay docks in Runcorn and Dock Office in Manchester. (The latter had a mainframe computer for running the payroll, I remember.) It&#8217;s a great reminder of the ways in which these huge industrial projects shaped the North-West, and I share the author&#8217;s happiness that the canal system is gradually being restored and put back to&nbsp;work.

      An enthusiastic paean to sleep and all it can do for us, from the perspective of a sleep scientist. If there was ever any doubt of the benefits of sleep – and the damage done by denying oneself or others of it – then this is it. <br><br>It&#8217;s a refreshingly un-preachy book, presenting both the latest science and some prescriptions for those who find sleep difficult. Along the way there are some side-swipes at those to claim to do well on only four hours a night (the science clearly says otherwise), as well as at the educational system for forcing early hours onto teenage brains working to a different rhythm. While I suspect the situation is better in the <span class="caps">UK</span> and Europe than in the <span class="caps">US</span>, there still seems to be a good argument for changes in timetabling even at university level to accommodate the physiological limitations of younger&nbsp;students,

      Does exactly what the title suggests. As one might imagine it&#8217;s a rapid race through a lot of history, but the key currents are clear to see: the nature of Germany changes from east to west, to the extent that the two areas remain religiously, politically, and intellectually distinct even to this day.<br><br>The effects of geography on history are made clear by the persistence of certain demarcations even when one might not imagine them. The Roman <i>limes</i>, the line of forts on the western edge, define a boundary based on the ease of campaigning in the countryside; there&#8217;s then another Roman boundary at the Elbe, with the area between the two being the extent of Roman punitive expeditions. But these lines essentially track the borders of the future West Germany, as the Russian, American, and British armies met at the Elbe at the end of the Second World War, freezing what was a Roman boundary into 20th century&nbsp;geopolitics.

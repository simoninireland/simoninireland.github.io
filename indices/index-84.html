			<p>Introducing some notes on low-power Arduino&nbsp;programming.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>In 2013 I did a summer project on using the <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> as a platform for &#8220;citizen sensing&#8221;. This rapidly became an exploration of how to create hardware and software that can do sensing while operating in a very low-power regime, such as one would need for an environmental&nbsp;sensor.</p>
<p>There were several results from this project &#8212; one of which <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> an actual solution to the motivating problem I&#8217;d come up with. However, it did generate a lot of notes about low-power Arduino programming, both for hardware and software, and a software library that embodies some of&nbsp;them</p>
<p>I recently decommissioned the web site I was using to host this content, so I&#8217;ve ported it onto my main blog as a collection of <a href="../development/projects/citizen-sensing/">research and development notes</a> in case it&#8217;s still of interest to&nbsp;anyone.</p>

      A narrative history of a largely forgotten mass murder. It&#8217;s a very American tale, in many ways: the Osage Native American Nation is exiled from its homelands and forced to live on a rocky and barren reservation of worthless land – which then turns out to sit on top of huge oil deposits. In many ways the tribe is lucky, because the laws of the <span class="caps">US</span> have advanced sufficiently that they are allowed to licence their oil rather than being moved on again; in other ways they are unlucky because, in order to avoid making native rich too easily, a system of &#8220;guardianship&#8221; is instituted whereby &#8220;incompetent&#8221; Native Americans have their interests looked after by local whites, which turns out to be an open invitation for fraud, theft, and murder. It becomes such an industry that husbands can honestly say, when asked their profession, &#8220;I married an Osage&#8221;.<br><br>The killings and the investigation are carefully and dramatically described, but the real sting is in the tail, the last chapter that demonstrates how the investigations were really only the tip of an iceberg that gave rise to a huge number of unexplained and unexamined deaths as whites sought control of the oil revenues. While the case gave rise to the <span class="caps">FBI</span> in its modern form (and was used ruthlessly by J. Edgar Hoover), its investigation was plainly deficient and limited in order to generate maximum victory with limited wider scandal. It&#8217;s an open question how many other allegedly &#8220;closed&#8221; cases hide a similar&nbsp;secret.

      Discussions of human origins invariably rest on rather shaky foundations. The fossil record – such as it is – has huge gaps, isn&#8217;t a random sample of the fauna, and only preserves the gross features of anatomy evident in bones. So it&#8217;s hardly surprising that a range of theories have been proposed to explain the division between apes and humans.<br><br>The aquatic ape hypothesis is one such. It has some supporting evidence – or, rather, it isn&#8217;t definitively contradicted by the evidence that there is. In this it falls into the common evidential trap of turning a lack of evidence against into <i>prima facie</i> evidence for: the classic pseudoscience bait-and-switch.<br><br>It&#8217;s possible to pose the theory at several strengths. The strongest, that hominids went through an aquatic phase long enough to give rise to evolutionary adaptations that haven&#8217;t been wholly lost, seems unsupported; the weakest, that hominids spent time near water and waded in order to access rich food supplies, seems unobjectionable.I&#8217;m unconvinced there&#8217;s much else to it, or indeed that there ever <i>could</i> be given the limitations of the evidence available. <br><br></p>

3rd Workshop on Engineering Collective Adaptive Systems – eCAS 2018
In conjunction with <a href="http://fasstar.org/"><span class="caps">FAS</span>* 2018</a>

<strong><span class="caps">AIMS</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">MOTIVATION</span></strong>

Modern software systems are becoming more and more collective, composed of many distributed and heterogeneous entities. These systems operate under continuous perturbations making manual adjustments infeasible. For a collective system to be resilient, its adaptation must also be collective, in the sense that multiple entities must adapt in a way that addresses critical runtime conditions while preserving the benefits of the collaborative interdependencies. Decision-making in such systems is distributed and possibly highly dispersed, and interaction between the entities may lead to the emergence of unexpected phenomena.

In such systems, a new approach for adaptation is needed to allow (i) multiple entities to collectively adapt with (ii) negotiations to decide which collective changes are best. Collective adaptation also raises a second important challenge: which parts of the system (things, services, people) should be engaged in an adaptation? This is not trivial, since multiple solutions to the same problem may be generated at different levels. The challenge here is to understand these levels and create mechanisms to decide the right scope for an adaptation for a given problem.

This workshop solicits papers that address new methodologies, theories and principles that can be used in order to develop a better understanding of the fundamental factors underpinning the operation of such systems, so that we can better design, build, and analyze them, as well as case studies and applications showing such approaches in action. Interdisciplinary work is particularly welcomed.

<strong>Suggested Topics (but not limited to):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Novel theories relating to operating principles of&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Novel design principles for building <span class="caps">CAS</span>&nbsp;systems</li>
    <li>Insights into the short and long-term adaptation of <span class="caps">CAS</span>&nbsp;systems</li>
    <li>Insights into emergent properties of&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Insights into general properties of large scale, distributed&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Decision-making approaches in&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Methodologies for studying, analyzing, and building&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Frameworks for analyzing or developing <span class="caps">CAS</span> case&nbsp;studies</li>
    <li>Languages, platforms, APIs and other tools for&nbsp;<span class="caps">CAS</span></li>
    <li>Scenarios, case studies, and experience reports of <span class="caps">CAS</span> in different contexts (e.g., Smart Mobility, Smart Energy/Smart Grid, Smart Buildings, traffic management, emergency response,&nbsp;etc.)</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="caps">SCOPE</span></strong>

The workshop is expected to attract participants from many disciplines, including Autonomic Computing, Biology, Game Theory, Evolutionary Computing, Network Science, Self-Organizing Systems, Pervasive Computing, and to be of interest to anyone working with the domain of large-scale self-adaptive systems. In addition, the European Commission has funded seven scientific projects and a Coordination Action in this area, with projects starting at the beginning of 2013. Thus, the workshop provides a natural base for the projects to meet and share ideas, even if it is in no way limited to this audience, and is likely to have broad appeal to a wide range of researchers. Potential audience members might work in application areas relating to large-scale distributed systems, or may come from any of the many disciplines that can provide insights into the operation and design of such systems.

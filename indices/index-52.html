		</div>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Happy 2014! We&#8217;re particularly happy to be making the first release of the SleepySketch library for writing low-power Arduino sketches.

<!--more-->

SleepySketch changes the way you write Arduino sketches by letting the library, rather than the main body of the sketch, decide when to run code. The sketch stays asleep as much as possible, with the Arduino placed into a low-power state to preserve battery.

This is a first release of SleepySketch, for comments. It provides a sketch framework, a basic sleep manager, and an example &#8220;blinkenlights&#8221; demonstration to show how the system fits together. Future releases will provide more flexible sleep management and support for component-level power management for common components like Xbee radios.

You can download SleepySketch v. 0.1 from <a href="../download/sleepysketch/">here</a>.

	Jacob Bronowski&nbsp;(1973)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Often described as one of the classics of our times, this is a book of essays charting the various stages in the author&#8217;s conception of the intellectual evolution of humanity. In a sense it should be compared to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/330451.Civilisation" title="Civilisation by Kenneth Clark" rel="nofollow noopener">Civilisation</a>, Kenneth Clarke&#8217;s history of art: a personal selection of important events.<br><br>Bronowski&#8217;s is a selection few would argue with, but he adds interest through his own personal acquaintanceship with some of the characters involved: Einstein, Born, and (most interestingly) von Neumann. His take on early history had probably been overtaken by some of modern anthropology, but his analysis of the industrial revolution is fascinating, as is his central thesis that the main agent of progress is simply the desire of the craftsman to improve his craft, beyond any real pressure for improvement coming from&nbsp;outside.

      Not an easy read, but a compelling overview of the Chinese revolution and the ways in which the Communists seized power. It focuses almost entirely on the Chinese perspective where it might have been interesting to have some foreign perspectives as well; in a similar vein, a more in-depth coverage of the impact of the Korean war might have made the relationship with the outside world more clear. Or perhaps that&#8217;s partially the point: the revolution cut China off from the world to the extent that there <i>was</i> no relationship of any great degree.<br><br>What comes across most strongly is the wasted lives, the ways in which the Communist party was willing to ignore (if not destroy) the talents of its people for reasons of pure ideology &#8212; something the Cambodians were to do, altogether more violently, a few decades later. It&#8217;s a tribute to the resilience of the Chinese people that the country has managed to survive the experience and re-engage with the world again, but the scars are sure to linger for many years to&nbsp;come.

		</div>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews has around eight  fully-funded PhD positions available. I&#8217;d welcome applicants interested in sensor networks, complex systems, and data science.

<!--more-->

We welcome students from a wide range of countries, our only major requirements being that you&#8217;re excited by the idea of research and are able to conduct a complex programme within a small, friendly, and supportive environment.

In my case, I&#8217;m interested in hearing from potential students with interests in the following&nbsp;areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensor networks, especially deploying sensors into the&nbsp;environment;</li>
    <li>Complex system modelling, trying to model phenomena that operate on a range of scales;&nbsp;and</li>
    <li>Data science, particularly for how we collect, categorise, and work with large scientific&nbsp;datasets.</li>
</ul>
An early conversation by skype or email could be followed by a formal application, the details of which are available <a href="http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AHU246/funded-phd-research-studentships/" target="_blank">here</a>.

	Nate Silver&nbsp;(2012)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      An essential book for anyone concerned with &#8220;big data&#8221; or any aspect of science of forecasting. Silver casts an experienced (and somewhat jaundiced) eye over a range of commonly-encountered forecasts, including politics (his own main area), poker, finance, and climate change. In each area he manages both to convince that forecasts can be made to good effect &#8212; and to demolish many of the current practices one finds in these areas. On the way he discusses Bayesian statistics, the psychology of a good forecaster (be a &#8220;fox,&#8221; not a &#8220;hedgehog&#8221;), how to spot bias, and gives some critical advice that would be of useful to anyone looking to apply such techniques. Should be required reading for all science PhD&nbsp;students.

      A <i>tour de force</i> of creative scientific answers. It&#8217;s perhaps less enjoyable than the original <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662.What_If__Serious_Scientific_Answers_to_Absurd_Hypothetical_Questions__What_If____1_" title="What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions (What If?, #1) by Randall Munroe" rel="nofollow noopener">What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions</a> – but only because it <i>is</i> a sequel, and so lacks the novelty of the first. It&#8217;s still a rush, ranging from cosmology down to particle physics, with enough black holes to satisfy anyone. And I also learned about the <a href="https://mybestplace.com/en/article/ussuri-bay-the-most-beautiful-glass-beach-in-the-world" rel="nofollow noopener">Glass beach of Vladivostok</a>, which is a place I&#8217;d never imagined existed and made the book worthwhile all on its own, just as Randall said it&nbsp;would.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc446e57">
<p>
Sometimes we publish papers with authors in alphabetical order;
sometimes we use an order based on contribution, typically the main
author (often the most junior) first followed by the lesser
contributors and culminating in the most senior author, who might not
have made many concrete contributions to the writing. Personally I&#8217;m
a firm believer in the second&nbsp;style.
</p>

<p>
But I always wondered: how does one list authors in alphabetical
order for languages like Chinese that are non-alphabetic? I had the
opportunity to ask a couple of Chinese&nbsp;colleagues.
</p>

<p>
While Chinese doesn&#8217;t have an <i>alphabetical</i> order, it can use a
<i>stroke</i> order: some surnames require more strokes than others,
often significantly more (four <i>versus</i> eleven, in the case of the
two colleagues who explained this to me). So one can list authors in
order of the increasing numbers of strokes needed to write their
surnames.  That&#8217;s really clever, and no more or less arbitrary in
terms of author appearance than the alphabetic&nbsp;approach.

Pain is a <i>signal</i> that can be triggered by damage, but can also be caused in response to less physical causes such as fear and a memory of past damage – and can be suppressed by activity or positive thinking, at least to a degree. This is awkward ground, as Lyman recognises: it&#8217;s close to saying that &#8220;it&#8217;s all in the mind&#8221;, which is both literally true and deeply offensive to those suffering persistent pain.

Soldiers frequently report it: they also sometimes feel significantly less pain from their injuries than civilians, because an injury that takes you off the battlefield makes you <i>safer than you were</i>. The signals get mixed, and the pain felt changes accordingly. <br><br>There&#8217;s much to like in this book, not least a very thorough treatment of placebos. It does sometimes get lost in reporting yet another clinical trial, or yet another insight into neurochemistry.

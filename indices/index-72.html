      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      What was it like to be a sailor in the mid-nineteenth century? This book provides an evocative and compelling story. From the way in which Nantucket Island was once the centre of the world&#8217;s most valuable commercial trade, to the privations and hardships associated with whaling, the detail and contextualisation is impressive – and that&#8217;s before we even get to the main events, a whale turning and sinking the ship hunting it, the crew&#8217;s subsequent wandering the eastern Pacific in small open boats, their resort to cannibalism to stay alive, and the aftermath of their rescue. On the way we also encounter some wonderfully out-of-the-way islands, as well as a time when people – even sailors familiar with the waters – could reasonably (if inaccurately) fear murder and savagery on the various Pacific&nbsp;islands.

	Randy Shilts&nbsp;(1987)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      It&#8217;s hard to sum-up this book: part history, part in-depth analysis of gay society in the 1980&#8217;s, part polemic against the Reagan administration. Randy Shilts lived through it (and eventually succumbed himself), and he wonderfully captures the frustration, the fear, and the final sense of creeping inevitability as more and more in the core social circle fall away. <br><br>It&#8217;s also a fascinating study of how governments listen (or not) to their own scientists, as well as of the political in-fighting between science groups and the ways in which reality is so often shaped by the perceptions of those reviewing the evidence: obvious in hindsight, perhaps excusably resisted at least in the early stages. There are plenty of examples of more recent &#8220;epidemics&#8221; that actually were not as devastating as they were at first warned to be (<span class="caps">SARS</span> and nvCJD spring to mind) – which isn&#8217;t to excuse the quite despicable inaction later when things became clear. There&#8217;s a lot here to be learned about how to respond to news of impending devastation.<br><br>One advantage of writing this review late is that I can include recent events: the exoneration of one of the main villains of the piece, Gaetan Dugas, who was reviled as &#8220;patient zero&#8221;, deliberately spreading the epidemic more rapidly and widely. It <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/27/health/hiv-gaetan-dugas-patient-zero/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">turns out</a> that, whatever Dugas&#8217; actions, they didn&#8217;t give rise to as much secondary infection as was thought when Shilts wrote his book, and just goes to show how science is always a provisional&nbsp;activity.

	Henry Marsh&nbsp;(2014)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A deeply felt and insightful – if sometimes over-personalised – view of medicine, neurosurgery, and working within the <span class="caps">UK</span> <span class="caps">NHS</span>. It&#8217;s at times terrifying: some cancers are benign, some are malignant, but anything that recurs will basically kill you no matter how well you treated it the first time. It also doesn&#8217;t reassure to think that neurosurgeons hone their skills by operating, and by failing – and this by definition leaves damaged patients behind. But it&#8217;s also comforting to see the professionalism and skills on display, and to learn the surprising variety of perfectly treatable conditions from which one might suffer. Not for the fainthearted,&nbsp;though.

	Arthur Koestler&nbsp;(1940)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A classic of &#8220;fictional history&#8221;, focusing on the Stalinist counter-revolution of the 1930&#8217;s. The protagonist, Rubashov, struggles to understand what&#8217;s happening to him as he is imprisoned, set up for a show trial, and eventually executed.<br><br>Koestler brilliantly captures something that often seems inexplicable in the history of the period: why did so many of the main characters collude in their own destruction? He makes a convincing case that they were captured by their own revolutionary logic: having professed the supremacy of the revolution, the creative use of obviously unjust violence, and the subordination of the individual, they found themselves unable to argue or act in their own defence, and even found solace in performing <i>one last act</i> that aided the revolution even as it consumed them. Still inexplicable, but also somehow admirable that individuals could become so devoted to a cause, no matter what one thinks of&nbsp;it.

	Mary Beard&nbsp;(2015)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A distinguished historian&#8217;s swan song, a history of Rome that focuses on many of the neglected aspects of the period – and on why they are neglected. The experience of slaves, or women of the poor – of which we know next to nothing – are contrasted against the experience of Cicero, the first person in history we can &#8220;know&#8221; in a modern, biographical, sense. On the way Beard explores what it meant to be Roman, and so what it meant to be a part of the Empire from the perspective of the ordinary and elite peoples far from Italy.<br><br>For me the most radical observation that Beard makes is in identifying what counts as &#8220;important&#8221; Roman history. She essentially discounts the empire and the emperors as being a footnote, something that occurred after all vibrancy and creativity had passed. For her, the Republic and the characters around it – the Gracchi, Cicero himself, Pompei and Caesar – are the elements that gave us the important things we have taken from Rome. It&#8217;s an unusual argument, compellingly&nbsp;made.

Re-visits McCarthy&#8217;s discoveries (or inventions, depending on
your point of view), translating the <a href="/2024/03/07/recursive-functions-of-symbolic-expressions-and-their-computation-by-machine-part-i/">earliest work</a> into modern
Lisp&nbsp;notation.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It&#8217;s worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not just as a
landmark in the history of computers, but as a model for what
programming is tending to become in our own time. It seems to me that
there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so
far: the C model and the Lisp model. These two seem points of high
ground, with swampy lowlands between them. As computers have grown
more powerful, the new languages being developed have been moving
steadily toward the Lisp model. A popular recipe for new programming
languages in the past 20 years has been to take the C model of
computing and add to it, piecemeal, parts taken from the Lisp model,
like runtime typing and garbage&nbsp;collection.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Does a great job of making the central insights accessible,
including re-phrasing the meta-circular Lisp interpreter so as to
be executable in modern Common&nbsp;Lisp.

<p>
Well, the most powerful I&#8217;ve found so far,&nbsp;anyway.
</p>

<p>
Given my current obsession with <a href="/categories/lisp/">Lisp</a> you might reasonably expect it
to be in that language. But it isn&#8217;t: it&#8217;s in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)"><span class="caps">APL</span></a>, and it performs
one complete generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway&#8217; Game of Life</a> in one line of&nbsp;code:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  Life←{↑↑1 ⍵∨.∧3 4=+/,¯1 0 1∘.⊖¯1 0 1∘.⌽⊂⍵}
</pre></div>

<p>
…and does so inexplicably to anyone who doesn&#8217;t know <span class="caps">APL</span>,
obviously, but the <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/John_Scholes%27_Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">basic algorithm</a> is&nbsp;simple:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Take an array with 1 in each occupied cell and 0&nbsp;elsewhere</li>
<li>Build four new arrays by exchanging each element with its
neighbour up, down, left, and&nbsp;right</li>
<li>Sum these arrays, which places the number of neighbours into each&nbsp;cell</li>
<li>Cut-off these values to be 1 if the cell has a value of 3 or 4,
and 0&nbsp;otherwise</li>
<li>Re-format the arrays back into the starting&nbsp;configuration</li>
</ol>
<p>
I checked it out using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/"><span class="caps">GNU</span> <span class="caps">APL</span></a> and it works&nbsp;fine.
</p>

<p>
I discovered this gem by accident, actually implemented <a href="https://github.com/chmykh/apl-life">in <span class="caps">APL</span> in
Forth</a> where someone has developed <span class="caps">APL</span> as an embedded <span class="caps">DSL</span> within
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> (another language with which I have history). After a bit of
digging I found a similar <span class="caps">APL</span> in Lisp, <a href="https://github.com/phantomics/april">April</a>, which clearly needs&nbsp;exploring.
</p>

<p>
In many ways <span class="caps">APL</span> and Lisp are parallel tracks within programming
language evolution, taking a single data structure (lists or arrays)
and providing powerful ways to manipulate them. Lisp of course has
been extended with other data structures, including arrays, which
makes the fusion of array- and list-based programming rather&nbsp;attractive.
</p>

<p>
I can&#8217;t help asking myself what would have happened if <span class="caps">APL</span> hadn&#8217;t
fallen by the wayside. (I think this was inevitable, incidentally,
once the syntax became fixed: any language that requires its own
character set was always going to struggle.) We now have huge
applications for array processing, from graphics to machine
learning, and GPUs are from one perspective just <span class="caps">APL</span> accelerator
co-processors. The ideas are still massively&nbsp;relevant.

      I have very mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand it&#8217;s a triumph of computational experimental technique, taking an idea that was well-known (cellular automata) and subjecting it to rigorous exploration. This uncovers a lot of new science, not least showing that complex systems can arise from even the simplest set of rules, but also that this complexity falls into classes that show graded complexity depending purely on the fine structure of the initial conditions. That&#8217;s a massively important discovery.<br><br>On the other hand&#8230;. It&#8217;s hard to describe this as a &#8220;new kind&#8221; of science. &#8220;New science,&#8221; yes, but not indicative of a new paradigm or <i>way</i> of doing science, other than by emphasising the structured use of simulation. Wolfram completely over-sells what he&#8217;s achieved, making claims he can&#8217;t substantiate to aggrandise his own contributions. And that&#8217;s a shame, not least because it&#8217;s so <i>unnecessary</i>: Wolfram has made some important discoveries, both here and to several other branches of physics and computer science, as well as popularising computational methods and tools. It&#8217;s tragic that he doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to appreciate himself as being sufficient.<br><br>The book is also quite terribly written, being almost half-composed of footnotes, meaning a reader is constantly skipping forwards and back: difficult in print, and I suspect impossible in a digital edition unless it&#8217;s been very carefully hyperlinked. And the footnotes are often important! – indeed, they often provide evidence to back-up a claim in the main text that&#8217;s entirely unsupportable from what&#8217;s been presented. So it can be seen as both excessively long and insufficiently detailed, which is quite an&nbsp;achievement.

      Why is modern civilisation so self-destructive and complicated? The answer from this alternative history is that a previously time of happiness and long lives was subverted by a change in the universal forces to induce the current malaise.<br><br>I did enjoy this book, but it does live up to its sub-title: <i>Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days</i>. It&#8217;s told in a very disjointed form using purported reports and other documents, much of the time from the diary of a young girl who doesn&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s going on, and so can&#8217;t really advance the plot very effectively. That makes it hard work, even though the writing and the overall premise are&nbsp;excellent.

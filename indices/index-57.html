    <p>
      Part memoir, part self-help book, this is an excellent overview of an astronaut's life and the mental attitudes that have made it possible. Chris Hadfield flew into space three times, and manages to share both the excitement and the boredom and attention to detail that allowed him to successfully become an astronaut and crown his career by commanding the International Space Station.

			<p>Two post-doctoral positions in smart cities now available at Trinity College Dublin.

<strong>Research Fellowships in Autonomic Service-Oriented Computing for Smart Cities</strong>

Applications are invited for two Postdoctoral Research Fellowships at <a href="http://www.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/" target="_blank">Trinity College Dublin’s Distributed Systems Group</a> to investigate the provision of a new service-oriented computing infrastructure that provides demand-based composition of software services interacting with a city-wide, dynamic network infrastructure. The project will investigate autonomic adaptation of services and infrastructure, ensuring resilient service provision within an integrated, city-wide system.

Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a closely-related discipline and strong C++/C#/Java development skills. Experience with autonomic computing, service-oriented middleware, and/or smart city technologies is desirable as are strong mathematical skills.

The project is supported by Science Foundation Ireland under the Principal Investigator programme between 2014-2018 and will be conducted in collaboration with Cork Institute of Technology, NUI Maynooth, IBM Smarter Cities Research Centre, Intel Intelligent Cities Lab, EMC2 Research Europe, and Arup.  The position is tenable from September 2014.

Please apply by email to <a href="mailto:Siobhan.Clarke@scss.tcd.ie">Siobhan.Clarke@scss.tcd.ie</a> quoting “Smart Cities Fellowship” in the subject line. Applications should include a curriculum vitae, in PDF format, giving full details of qualifications and experience, together with the names of two referees. The closing date for applications is the 20th June, 2014.

Trinity College is an equal opportunities employer.

<h3>EAI Transactions on Self-Adaptive Systems</h3>
<a href="http://eai.eu/transaction/self-adaptive-systems" target="_blank">http://eai.eu/transaction/self-adaptive-systems</a>

<strong>SCOPE</strong>

This journal seeks contributions from leading experts from research and practice of self-adaptive systems that will provide the connection between theory and practice with the ultimate goal to bring both the science and industry closer to the so-called "autonomic culture" and successful realization of self-adaptive systems. Both theoretical and applied contributions related to the relevance and potential of engineering methods, approaches and tools for self-adaptive systems are particularly welcome. This applies to application areas and technologies such as:
<ul>
<li>adaptable user interfaces</li>
    <li>adaptable security and privacy</li>
    <li>autonomic computing</li>
    <li>dependable computing</li>
    <li>embedded systems</li>
    <li>genetic algorithms</li>
    <li>knowledge representation and reasoning</li>
    <li>machine learning</li>
    <li>mobile <em>ad hoc</em> networks</li>
    <li>mobile and autonomous robots</li>
    <li>multi-agent systems</li>
    <li>peer-to-peer applications</li>
    <li>sensor networks</li>
    <li>service-oriented architectures</li>
    <li>ubiquitous computing</li>
</ul>
It also hold for many research fields, which have already investigated some aspects of self-adaptation from their own perspective, such as
fault-tolerant computing, distributed systems, biologically inspired computing, distributed artificial intelligence, integrated management, robotics, knowledge-based systems, machine learning, control theory, etc.

<strong>MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION</strong>

Manuscripts should present original work in the scope of the journal and must be exclusively submitted to this journal, must not have been published before, and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. Significantly extended and expanded versions of papers published in conference proceedings can be submitted, providing also a detailed description of the additions. Regular papers are limited to a maximum of 20 pages. Prepare and submit your manuscript by following the instructions provided <a href="http://eai.eu/transaction/self-adaptive-systems" target="_blank">here</a>.

	Stanisław Lem
	  (1961)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      An atmospheric and episodic tale of first contact. The descriptions are wonderful, and the focus on character is far more detailed than is common even in first-class science fiction. Lem leaves most of the plot elements unfinished, which is somewhat dissatisfying at one level but leaves plenty of space for the reader's imagination to play.

	Michael   Lewis
	  (2014)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Another of Michael Lewis' now-classic tales of Wall Street misadventure, this one focusing on the all-but-unseen - and even less understood - growth of high-frequency trading (HFT). This one follows the efforts of a small group of insiders to create a new stock exchange that's immune both by policy and by design to the arbitrage and strategies HFT uses to game the conventional exchanges. A fascinating list of characters cross the pages, including Russian programmers, disaffected traders, and a network guy from Dublin - all working to make a system that was paying them well disappear in the interests of fairness (and their own long-term financial gain).<br><br>At one level this book is less satisfying than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8032112.The_Big_Short_Inside_the_Doomsday_Machine" title="The Big Short Inside the Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis" rel="nofollow noopener">The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine</a>, perhaps because the story still hasn't finished. The reader is left wanting to know the fate of the new IEX exchange, and the way the market changed as a result. For a techie, it's also unsatisfying that so much of the technology remains unexplored, although it would obviously have made the book inaccessible to anyone but a computer junkie: perhaps there's a much more technical follow-up that could be written.<br><br>Although the story mainly revolves a case of market failure - high-frequency traders capturing huge value while taking no risk and providing no real advantage - it's also in a strange way an example of market success, when Goldman Sachs and other banks realise that their support of HFT is simply too risky for the gains they're capturing themselves. There's also an irony in the banks' worrying that, in the case of another crash, the banks will take the losses while the HFT firms walk away with the gains - which is exactly the reverse of the situation after the 2008 crash, where the public took up the banks' bad debts. Whether this is a sign of things to come is hard to decide, but it does show how even the most dysfunctional system can be changed when people recognise its dysfunction and are prepared to act to remediate it.

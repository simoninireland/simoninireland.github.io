      The Hohenzollerns are usually treated as bookmarks in histories of the two World Wars, with the Kaiser as an essential instigator of the First and laying the groundwork for the Second despite his defenestration. This book picks up his life in exile in the Netherlands as an increasingly anachronistic character unable to handle the need to explain himself even to his own most loyal followers.<br><br>That loyalty and blindness extends to his descendants, who remain pretenders to leadership well into the Nazi period and attempt to ride the storm while simultaneously keeping a distance from it, unable to accept that they&#8217;re no longer relevant or even respected except in the most superficial ways. It&#8217;s as though they want to take credit for Nazi accomplishments and are untroubled by the atrocities as long as it offers the possibility of a return to the throne – and are similarly untroubled by the fact that that thronw would never actually be a real power centre. The Kaiser&#8217;s emphasis on the forms over the functions of royalty have a long reach.<br><br>The translation is little grating at times, fascinated by the word <i>caesura</i>. But the pace is good and it deals well with the contradictions and (still continuing) attempts to rewrite family history to remove the taint of association with Hitler – while (coincidentally I&#8217;m sure) restoring family&nbsp;property.

      £5 well spent in a charity shop. This is a collection of essays on different historical mysteries. There&#8217;s something for everyone: the building of Stonehenge, the abandonment of the <i>Mary Celeste</i>, and (my personal favourite) the fate of the Princes in the Tower. Perhaps a book best dipped into.<br><br>Some of the essays haven&#8217;t aged well against subsequent scholarship. That&#8217;s inevitable and doesn&#8217;t detract from them as decent introductions to a wide range of&nbsp;happenings.

      I was expecting a book that was more calculator focussed, perhaps misled by the sub-title. This <i>is</i> a book about pocket (and other) calculators, but it&#8217;s more a book about <i>calculation</i> and its mechanical assistants, from the abacus and Napier&#8217;s Bones through to computers.<br><br>And that having been said, it&#8217;s a great history. It addresses the needs that have driven mechanical computation over the centuries, as the applications have changed alongside the technology (and in many ways have driven its development). You can see this in the way that the scale of the machines changes, becoming alternately smaller and more pocket-sized and then larger as the increasing demands require steam or electrical power. (The latter can be miniaturised while the former clearly can&#8217;t.)<br><br>What we would actually regard as pocket calculators occupy only a tiny part of the story. I think there&#8217;s a more detailed history that could still be written about the different processors used, methods of entry used (for example <span class="caps">HP</span>&#8217;s determined and continued use of reverse-Polish notation), and how these were taken up by sub-groups within science, engineering, and finance and used almost as tribal signifiers (&#8220;<i>real</i> engineers use <span class="caps">HP</span>&#8221;). But that would miss the wider story that this book tells&nbsp;well.

Mark Watson.  <i><a href="https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp">Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer’s Secret
Weapon</a></i>. Leanpub.&nbsp;2023.
</p>

<p>
While pitched as a way of sharing the author&#8217;s enthusiasm for Lisp
(which really shines through), this book is really a deep
demonstration in using Lisp in modern applications – from web
APIs and the semantic web to deep learning, large language models,
and&nbsp;chatbots.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, like many other Lisp books, it&#8217;s really two books in
one. The first chapters are introductory – and to be perfectly
honest could be dispensed with, as they&#8217;re inadequate as a proper
introduction and there are far better introductions out there. The
later chapters focus on applications, and provide the real value.
One could criticise them as often tying-together tools in other
languages, with the Lisp code basically being glue; but that&#8217;s a
very effective way of leveraging all the code and services out
there, and is an important technique for Lisp programmers&nbsp;too.

</p>

<p>
An interview on the Corecursive podcast with Ron&nbsp;Garret.
</p>

<p>
In 1988 (when, for context, I was in the second year of my BSc)
Garret started working on autonomous navigation software for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_(rover)">Sojourner</a>, <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s first Mars rover, which flew in 1997. He used Lisp
to do planning, essentially developing an entire domain-specific
language for autonomous vehicles. The project was never flown, as
<span class="caps">NASA</span> opted for a far less ambitious approach to driving to rovers –
a decision that Garret now considers to have been the correct&nbsp;one.
</p>

<p>
But that isn&#8217;t the end of the story, because Garret then went on
to develop an autonomous Remote Agent controller for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_1">Deep
Space 1</a> technology demonstration mission that performed asteroid
and comet fly-bys. Without spoiling to story, the spacecraft flies
with a full Lisp system onboard, and Garret gets to interact with
its <span class="caps">REPL</span> at a distance of 30 light-minutes <i>via</i> the Deep Space
Network – surely the longest latency of any <span class="caps">REPL</span> session&nbsp;ever!
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s an fascinating insight into both the potentials of Lisp and
the political difficulties that using a non-standard development
language can&nbsp;engender.
</p>

<p>
<span class="caps">UPDATE</span> 2024-05-16: Ron also wrote a <a href="https://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">short essay</a> about his&nbsp;experiences.

      It&#8217;s unusual to read a book that probably couldn&#8217;t have been written before <i>or</i> after it actually was: the political environment of China thawed just enough to give people confidence to speak to a foreign author about the events of the Cultural Revolution.<br><br>The horrors shine through, in the memories of the young Red Guards and their victims. But so too do the current sensitivities, not least in the rather farcical museums and monuments that can be found across China – but that can&#8217;t be visited, because the custodians race to close them up &#8220;for maintenance&#8221; as soon as a visitor arrives. It&#8217;s a different approach to that described in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50215644.Between_Two_Fires_Truth__Ambition__and_Compromise_in_Putin_s_Russia" title="Between Two Fires Truth, Ambition, and Compromise in Putin's Russia by Joshua Yaffa" rel="nofollow noopener">Between Two Fires: Truth, Ambition, and Compromise in Putin&#8217;s Russia</a>, where museums are re-assigned to new curators who subtly change their message, but it reinforces the fears that authoritarian regimes have of their own histories and those who might actually remember them.<br><br>China has never had a public reckoning with the Cultural Revolution – and it doesn&#8217;t look that it will have one for a long time. The message of this book is that this hiding of the past continues to do damage to the present, not least because it provides a vague and unexamined fear of disorder that can be used to justify repression &#8220;in case it happens again&#8221;. But the fact is that it didn&#8217;t just &#8220;happen&#8221;: it was commanded, by a regime that&#8217;s the linear predecessor of the current leadership who seem to want to both disown it <i>and</i> levarage it for their own ends.<br></p>

Programmers</a></i>. Leanpub.&nbsp;2013.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m not convinced by the sub-title: at the very least, there&#8217;s no
evidence to support the claim that Lisp programmers really are
hundreds of time more productive. But there are some serious
insights here from individuals who&#8217;ve made serious contributions
to the Lisp world – and beyond. The contributions all take the
form of email interviews consisting of a standard prelude of
questions (how did you discover Lisp?, do you use it at work?)
followed by a couple of questions tailored to the&nbsp;interviewee.
</p>

<p>
The practitioners selected have all been affected by Lisp, either
in terms of it changing their own thought processes, or by helping
to develop the core ecosystem, or by applying Lisp to real-world
problems, and often to great effect. My favourite was the
discussion with someone who was using Common Lisp to develop
low-latency network routing for financial services: it&#8217;s hard
to think of a better example of Lisp&#8217;s power and&nbsp;range.

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html">My Lisp Experiences and the Development of <span class="caps">GNU</span>&nbsp;Emacs</a>
</p>

<p>
The never-dull Richard Stallman talks about his experiences with
Lisp and with the development of Emacs. It&#8217;s got some useful
observations on <i>why</i> Lisp became the core of Emacs: it was news to
me that this hadn&#8217;t always been the case. It started with an
&#8220;editor control&#8221; language in the spirit of editors&nbsp;like <code>ed</code>. But as
people wanted more support from their editor, they wanted to
program it more&nbsp;effectively.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The language that you build your extensions on shouldn&#8217;t be
thought of as a programming language in afterthought; it should be
designed as a programming language. In fact, we discovered that
the best programming language for that purpose was&nbsp;Lisp.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The result was a re-write of Emacs in C (for portability), with a
Lisp interpreter specialised towards editing&nbsp;tasks.
</p>

<p>
He then gives an insider&#8217;s perspective on the Lisp machines and
their evolution, as well as revealing the genesis of his ideas for
the free software movement. While these are interesting to read,
it should be noted that much of it has been rebutted: his
description of the formation and later history of the two
spin-outs, Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc, is strongly disputed
by Dan Weinreb on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090101103828/http://danweinreb.org/blog/rebuttal-to-stallmans-story-about-the-formation-of-symbolics-and-lmi">his blog</a>.)

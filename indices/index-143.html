Could social media posts be actively damaging to our mental health?
– literally, not just figuratively? That&#8217;s the premise of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/09/techscape-deepfakes-cognitohazards-science-fiction">a
TechScape article in The Guardian</a>, that draws on both science
fiction and psychological&nbsp;research.
</p>

<p>
In Neal Stephenson&#8217;s &#8220;Snow crash&#8221; there is a plot device of an image
in a metaverse that, when viewed, crashes the viewer&#8217;s brain. We
haven&#8217;t seen this in social media (yet), but there&#8217;s an increasing
concern about deepfake images and other forms of misinformation.
Research suggests that such images are damaging <i>even if viewers
know that they&#8217;re fakes</i>, which suggests that techniques like
content-labelling images as <span class="caps">AI</span>-generated are insufficient to remove
their harm. Other examples include massively engaging artificial
images such as the &#8220;pong wars&#8221; animation of two simultaneous
&#8220;Breakout&#8221; games going on between two algorithms: something that
shouldn&#8217;t be as engaging as it is (as I can attest to&nbsp;myself).
</p>

<p>
Social media attention grabbing at an industrial scale might
therefore constitute a <i>cognitohazard</i>, a way of hacking people&#8217;s
brains simply by being&nbsp;viewed.

      The history of what is still as I write this an ongoing scandal: perhaps the greatest miscarriage of justice in <span class="caps">UK</span> history, when the Post Office turned on and prosecuted its own operators for fraud on the basis of flawed evidence from its Horizon <span class="caps">IT</span> system.<br><br>The scandal came from a series of interlocking arrangements. The Post Office could mount prosecutions in its own right (something that its management now claims to have been unaware of), with its own investigators able to interview under caution but seemingly not required to record interviews or allow legal representation. The contracts under which postmasters operated were mis-represented to turn any discrepancies into the postmasters&#8217; fault, while simultaneously denying them the data they&#8217;d need to investigate themselves unless they were exceptionally careful and persistent – and the few who <i>were</i> were prosecuted and driven out anyway. <br><br>As a computer scientist I have to say that the most ridiculous part of the story is the presumption in law that a computer system works properly absent explicit to the contrary, that – when coupled with an asymmetry of who can access to software and its logs – makes it impossible to fight against computer-generated evidence. No system of this size <i>ever</i> works flawlessly, and a careful designer would add features on that assumption, such as paper-trails or detailed logs that can then be forensically analysed. Equally, no such system would ever be constructed without remote access to terminal endpoints to allow problems to be remotely fixed, and again a careful designer would ensure that such interventions were logged so as to be auditable. This is so self-evident that I find it hard to believe that Horizon <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> designed that way, which makes the repeated denials even more suspicious.<br><br>But there&#8217;s a social commentary here too. The justice system, juries, and the communities of the prosecuted postmasters were almost eager to believe their guilt. Part of that was the lack of proper media scrutiny to bring the extent of prosecutions into the public eye, and part due to obfuscation by the Post Office itself – but it surely there should be systemic oversight of such things, given the massive consequences. And surely communities should have been less ready to believe accusations made against their own members that went against the evidence of their own&nbsp;eyes.

Mark Watson.  <i><a href="https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp">Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer’s Secret
Weapon</a></i>. Leanpub.&nbsp;2023.
</p>

<p>
While pitched as a way of sharing the author&#8217;s enthusiasm for Lisp
(which really shines through), this book is really a deep
demonstration in using Lisp in modern applications – from web
APIs and the semantic web to deep learning, large language models,
and&nbsp;chatbots.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, like many other Lisp books, it&#8217;s really two books in
one. The first chapters are introductory – and to be perfectly
honest could be dispensed with, as they&#8217;re inadequate as a proper
introduction and there are far better introductions out there. The
later chapters focus on applications, and provide the real value.
One could criticise them as often tying-together tools in other
languages, with the Lisp code basically being glue; but that&#8217;s a
very effective way of leveraging all the code and services out
there, and is an important technique for Lisp programmers&nbsp;too.

<a href="https://corecursive.com/lisp-in-space-with-ron-garret/">Lisp in space</a> (podcast, 38&nbsp;minutes)
</p>

<p>
An interview on the Corecursive podcast with Ron&nbsp;Garret.
</p>

<p>
In 1988 (when, for context, I was in the second year of my BSc)
Garret started working on autonomous navigation software for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_(rover)">Sojourner</a>, <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s first Mars rover, which flew in 1997. He used Lisp
to do planning, essentially developing an entire domain-specific
language for autonomous vehicles. The project was never flown, as
<span class="caps">NASA</span> opted for a far less ambitious approach to driving to rovers –
a decision that Garret now considers to have been the correct&nbsp;one.
</p>

<p>
But that isn&#8217;t the end of the story, because Garret then went on
to develop an autonomous Remote Agent controller for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_1">Deep
Space 1</a> technology demonstration mission that performed asteroid
and comet fly-bys. Without spoiling to story, the spacecraft flies
with a full Lisp system onboard, and Garret gets to interact with
its <span class="caps">REPL</span> at a distance of 30 light-minutes <i>via</i> the Deep Space
Network – surely the longest latency of any <span class="caps">REPL</span> session&nbsp;ever!
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s an fascinating insight into both the potentials of Lisp and
the political difficulties that using a non-standard development
language can&nbsp;engender.
</p>

<p>
<span class="caps">UPDATE</span> 2024-05-16: Ron also wrote a <a href="https://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">short essay</a> about his&nbsp;experiences.

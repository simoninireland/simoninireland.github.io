Edmund Weitz.  <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-1176-2">Common Lisp Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach</a></i>.
Apress.&nbsp;2016.
</p>

<p>
An extensive list of recipes for using common data structures,
how the differ in Lisp from the equivalents in other languages,
and what novel features Lisp has to offer. A great place to start
when moving away from being a beginner, and for dipping into in
search of&nbsp;solutions.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s probably strongest on the &#8220;gotchas&#8221; and dangers that Lisp
presents, but also has a lot to say about coding style and code&nbsp;optimisation.

Michał &#8220;phoe&#8221; Herda.  <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-6134-7">The Common Lisp Condition System</a></i>. Apress.&nbsp;2020.
</p>

<p>
An enormously detailed look at the condition system, sometimes
regarded as the Lisp equivalent of exception-handling in other&nbsp;languages.
</p>

<p>
But that&#8217;s massively unfair to the condition system, which is
really a way to deal with non-local transfers of control in the
most flexible way possible. Exceptions are <i>just one type</i> of
this, and the condition system aims to separate three aspects that
are often combined in other languages: detecting and signalling a
condition, responding to a condition, and deciding on the binding
between the two, possibly combining responses differently in
different contexts. It&#8217;s a set of concepts that are in many ways
foreign to a lot of other languages, and so justify the detail for
those occasions when these techniques are appropriate: deciding
<i>when</i> they are appropriate is non-trivial, a matter of both
functionality and&nbsp;style.

John Allen.  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/542865"><i>Anatomy of Lisp</i></a>. McGraw-Hill. <span class="caps">ISBN</span>
0-07-001115-X.&nbsp;1978.
</p>

<p>
This is a hard book to characterise. It&#8217;s simultaneously an
introduction, a collection of advanced (for the time) programming
techniques, and a guide to some very low-level implementation
details. It contains a lot of the usual introductory material, but
then delves into different representational choices for the basic
data structures – lists, but also arrays and hash tables as well
as Lisp code itself – and for the frames needed to represent
function calls. It the tackles interpretation <i>versus</i>
compilation, and even topics such as cross-compilation and
just-in-time or memoised&nbsp;compilation.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s impossible to read this book without thinking of <a href="/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/"><span class="caps">SICP</span></a>, and
indeed I think in many ways it&#8217;s a direct precursor. (It&#8217;s
referenced a couple of times in <span class="caps">SICP</span>.) It has that same
combination of high-level, semantics-driven programming combined
with descriptions of underlying mechanisms. Where I think it
mainly differs is that it mixes representations, using a more
semantics-driven notation and explicit assembler instructions
rather than sticking with Lisp variants for <i>everything</i>. It&#8217;s
only when you see the two approaches side by side that you realise
how <i>clear</i> Lisp can be in radically different&nbsp;contexts..
</p>

<p>
Another important book was published in 1978: Kernighan and
Ritchie&#8217;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C programming language</a></i>. The two books share a
certain low-level focus, but come to very different conclusions
about the correct approach to dynamic storage, as the following
footnote by Allen (slightly edited for clarity)&nbsp;illustrates:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Experiments have been performed in which Lisp programmers were
allowed to return &#8220;garbage&#8221; to the free-space list themselves. The
results were disastrous: list structure thought to be garbage was
returned to the free-space list even though the structure was
still being used by other&nbsp;computations.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
C, of course, accepts this &#8220;disaster&#8221; as a natural consequence of
manual allocation management. It encapsulates the different
attitudes of the two contemporary language communities, though:
one wanting a machine in which to think (and willing to use
computing power to simplify tasks), and those wanting raw
performance from limited hardware (and willing to complicate the
programming task to get&nbsp;it).
</p>

<p>
Overall, Allen&#8217;s book is a great attempt at an end-to-end
discussion of Lisp all the way down to the metal. Many of the
techniques are still relevant, at least as exemplars against
later, more efficient, techniques should be&nbsp;judged.
</p>

Today I learned about a site that rates web pages according to their
carbon&nbsp;footprints.
</p>

<p>
My web site does&nbsp;well:

<p>
I&#8217;m not all that surprised by this, since I <a href="/development/this-site/">use</a> a static site
generator and minimal (almost no) JavaScript: basically as low-power
as one could&nbsp;get.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/simondobson-org/">full report</a> includes an approximate carbon cost per page visit
(60mg), and even tries to work out the underlying energy provision,
dirty or renewable – dirty in my case at the moment, unfortunately.
(I&#8217;m currently hosted on GitHub.) I should perhaps take the hint and
move onto an alternative provider, or even host it myself with a
solar-powered Raspberry Pi. <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low-tech Magazine</a> does this, but they
<i>are</i> based in Barcelona rather than&nbsp;Scotland…

<p>
You can even include a badge that reports your rating&nbsp;&#8220;live&#8221;:

<script src="https://unpkg.com/website-carbon-badges@1.1.3/b.min.js" defer></script><p>
(It caches so as to only make one request per day.) On the other
hand this increases the JavaScript footprint slightly, so I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;ll be using it anywhere apart from just&nbsp;here.

      An insight into the British politics of the 2010s.

And it&#8217;s true that she has plenty of insight into them and into her own position in the circle.<br><br>But she also exposes herself as almost a caricature of a Tory. She accepts the misogyny and crudeness of the male MPs as just how it is, and utterly lacks any understanding of why anyone would disagree with her own positions. She can&#8217;t accept, for example, that Remainers were sincere and their misgivings might be valid, or that the <span class="caps">EU</span> is anything other that fascinated with the idea of humiliating Britain. She constantly refers to the Labour party as &#8220;Marxists&#8221; and trots-out the usual tropes of how they would bankrupt the country, despite the fact that their &#8220;extreme left-wing&#8221; positions would be entirely mainstream in many European countries. She&#8217;s clear-eyed and unenthusiastic about Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, but then fawns over him when he wins his election landslide and glides over the time-bomb he planted on the Irish border issue, even though this was evident at the time.<br><br>The overwhelming theme, returned to again and again, is how self-interested the political class is, focused entirely on who&#8217;s up, who&#8217;s down, and how if affects their own careers.

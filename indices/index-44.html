			<p>Temperature sensing using digital temperature sensors is easy to get working.

<!--more-->

The temperature sensing part of the project requires three sensors for ambient, high-up and low-down measurement. The <a href="../2013/07/08/ds18b20/"><span class="caps">DS18B20</span> temperature sensor </a>seems well-suited for the job.

![<span class="caps">DS18B20</span>](/images/citizen-sensing/three-ds18b20.png)

Three <span class="caps">DS18B20</span> temperature sensors sharing a OneWire bus, standard (rail) power mode

Hooking-up a OneWire bus for the three sensors lets them share a single microcontroller pin &#8212; which isn&#8217;t important for hardware reasons in this project, but also saves some microcontroller <span class="caps">RAM</span>, which might be. The circuit is very simple, with the three sensors sharing power and ground lines and with a common data line pulled-up to the power rail through a 4.7K resistor. The <span class="caps">DQ</span> line is attached to one of the Arduino&#8217;s digital lines. The OneWire library is then used to instantiate a protocol handler for that line, and passed to the temperature control library to manage the interaction with the devices, including their conversion from raw to &#8220;real&#8221; temperature values.

The resulting code is almost comically&nbsp;simple:

That&#8217;s it! The temperature library packages everything up nicely, including the conversion and the interaction with the OneWire protocol (which is quite fiddly).

![Three DS18B30s on a prototyping shield](/images/citizen-sensing/ds18b20-prototype.jpg)

One potential problem for the future is that access to the sensors is by index, not by any particular identifier, and it;s not clear whether the ordering is always the same: does the sensor closest to the microcontroller always appear as index 0, for example? If not, then we&#8217;ll have to identify which sensor is which somehow to sample the temperature from the correct place, or run each one on a different OneWire bus instance.

There&#8217;s also an interesting point about parasite power mode, which is where the <span class="caps">DS18B20</span> draws its power from the data bus rather than from a dedicated power rail. This might make power management easier, since the sensor would be unpowered when not being used, such as when the Arduino is asleep. This suggests it&#8217;s probably worth looking into parasite power a bit more.

			<p>The <span class="caps">DS18B20</span> is a programmable digital thermometer that needs no calibration and uses only one wire of the microcontroller.

<!--more-->

The <a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/2812" target="_blank"><span class="caps">DS18B20</span></a> is extremely popular as a temperature sensor, for obvious reasons: they&#8217;re digital, and require no calibration, in contrast to using a thermistor or similar analogue device which would need to be characterised against reference temperatures. They&#8217;re not as cheap as analogue components, but their simplicity of use and accuracy probably make up for that in scientific applications.

The devices are also notable as using the OneWire protocol developed by Dallas Semiconductor (now Maxim) and used in (amongst other devices) their <a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/products/ibutton/" target="_blank">iButton</a> devices. Essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire" target="_blank">OneWire</a> is an embedded systems equivalent of <span class="caps">USB</span> that allows a set of devices to be chained together and addressed using only one pin on a microcontroller. This means that there&#8217;s no real limit on the number of sensors that even a small chip can make use of. The <a href="http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet</a> is available if needed, but they&#8217;re so easy to use and have such good software support (see below) that there&#8217;s no real need to refer to it.

The sensors are packaged almost like transistors, with three wires for ground, power, and data. The easiest way to use them is to power them directly with 5V and ground, and use the third wire for communications. (There&#8217;s also a &#8220;parasitic&#8221; mode that takes power from the data bus, which I haven&#8217;t got to work yet.) The communications line is the &#8220;one wire&#8221; that runs the communications protocol.

Using OneWire devices, and DS18B20s in particular, is made very simple by the existence of two libraries, providing the <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html" target="_blank">protocol driver</a> and <a href="http://milesburton.com/Dallas_Temperature_Control_Library" target="_blank">temperature conversion and packaging</a> respectively.

![Network](/images/citizen-sensing/network.jpg)

This step of the project accomplishes two things: is gets <span class="caps">API</span> networking mode working for the XBee radios, and makes sure the the interaction between software on the Arduinos and software running on the base station work too.

The data stream is simple enough: each Arduino counts up from 0 to 255 every 5s, passing the result up to the co-ordinator radio. A Processing program on the laptop collects the numbers and prints them. Naturally they become somewhat intertwined as their clocks aren&#8217;t quite synchronised.

Actually this is enough to perform a simple radio survey to check transmission distance: we can move the radios away from the base station until they lose contact (nominally 100m for these 2mW radios, in reality probably substantially less), then move back into range, and then move one of the radios again to check that it meshes with the intermediate node in reaching back to the base station. This will also check that battery power works.

![Meshing](/images/citizen-sensing/processing-xbee-api.png)

The software is quite straightforward, and the <a href="../2013/07/03/xbee-arduino/">xbee-arduino library</a> handles all the low-level communications &#8212; although it&#8217;s very low-level, fine for the experienced programmer but probably all but mystifying to anyone not used to this kind of software. The corresponding Java xbee-api library is slightly more friendly, but <em>only</em> slightly: they probably both need wrapping into a framework that hides the radio nastiness.

I think the biggest hurdle for this sort of system is the data format &#8212; or, more precisely, the need (or desire, at least) to to use C at one end and Processing/Java at the other, which means that the data on the wire is being described twice. A framework approach could use (for example) <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank"><span class="caps">JSON</span></a>, although there&#8217;d still be a need to make sure it was compactly encoded and&nbsp;transmitted.</p>

			<p>A library for using XBee radios with Arduinos.

<!--more-->

The XBee radio operates in <a href="../2013/07/01/xbee/" target="_blank">two modes</a>: transparent or text-based, and <span class="caps">API</span> or binary-based. The latter (<span class="caps">API</span> mode) is generally considered more suitable for computer-to-computer interactions, as it&#8217;s faster and simpler for computers to manipulate. However, using an XBee in this mode requires additional software.

The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/xbee-arduino/" target="_blank">xbee-arduino library</a> provides Arduino functions to access the <span class="caps">API</span> mode functionality of the various XBee radio modules. The library is quite low-level, but does provide access to all the necessary functions like issuing <span class="caps">AT</span> commands to control the modem and sensing and receiving packets of data to other radios in the mesh network.

To use the library you download the latest version from the web page and unpack it into the <tt>libraries/</tt> directory of your Arduino <span class="caps">IDE</span>. You also need to make sure that the radios you use have the <a href="../2013/07/02/xctu/" target="_blank"><span class="caps">API</span> function set installed using X-<span class="caps">CTU</span></a>, as the library only makes sense for radios in <span class="caps">API</span> mode. You also have to set the &#8220;<span class="caps">AP</span>&#8221; parameter to 2 when writing the&nbsp;firmware.</p>

			<p>Managing Digi&#8217;s XBee radio modules requires using their X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> package to upload the correct firmware. In this post we explain how.

<!--more-->

This post is slightly depressing: not because it&#8217;s on an unhappy topic, but because the effort and software needed to manage XBee radios is so complex to set up. In many ways this is just a function of the good design of the XBee: it&#8217;s so minimal in terms of footprint and power consumption at run-time that it offloads a lot of work to external tools (and the user) at system build-time. But it&#8217;s still a lot of work to get such a small piece of kit running.

X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> is intended to upload firmware to XBee radio modules. This is needed to change the firmware between router and co-ordinator of the Zigbee <a href="../2013/07/02/mesh-network/" target="_blank">mesh network</a>, and between the different protocol variants that the XBee radios can support.

![Xbee on <span class="caps">USB</span>](/images/citizen-sensing/2013-06-29-13.35.45.jpg)

One limitation of X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> is that it only works on Windows: if you&#8217;re running Linux, X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> will run under <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>. You can download the latest X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> from <a href="http://www.digi.com/support/kbase/kbaseresultdetl?id=2125" target="_blank">Digi&#8217;s X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> page</a>; alternatively, there&#8217;s a version installed on the <a href="../download/virtual-machine/" target="_blank">Citizen Sensing <span class="caps">VM</span></a>.

To use X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> you need to connect your XBee module to your computer. The easiest way to do this is using an XBee <span class="caps">USB</span> breakout board, which provides an XBee socket and a <span class="caps">USB</span> socket. Insert the radio into the board, plug in a <span class="caps">USB</span> cable, and plug the other end into a <span class="caps">USB</span> socket. The light on the breakout board will then come on (see photograph above).

![X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> in operation](/images/citizen-sensing/xctu-connect.png)

You next need to start up X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> and tell it where the XBee is. It hangs off a Windows <span class="caps">COM</span> port, and X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> will typically find it automatically. You should then be able to press the &#8220;Test/Query&#8221; button, and X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> will interrogate the XBee and display a small window showing some information about it, as shown in the screenshot on the right: the details don&#8217;t matter, but this shows that the XBee is talking to the computer properly.

![X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> router firmware](/images/citizen-sensing/xctu-firmware-router.png)

Assuming everything is now working correctly, the next step is to decide what firmware to download to the radio. Click on the &#8220;Modem configuration&#8221; tab, and then click the &#8220;Read&#8221; button: this reads the firmware that&#8217;s on the XBee at the moment, and puts the details into the window. Typically this results in a display like that shown on the left. The important things to notice are the two drop-down boxes labelled &#8220;Function Set&#8221; and &#8220;Version&#8221;. The function set is the description of the firmware, in which case indicating that the XBee is running Zigbee router firmware that responds to <span class="caps">AT</span> commands (more on this below).

![X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> co-ordinator firmware](/images/citizen-sensing/xctu-firmware-coordinator.png)

To download a new firmware, we then select the function set and version we want to use. Suppose we want to make this XBee into the mesh co-ordinator. We change the function set to &#8220;Zigbee Coordinator <span class="caps">AT</span>&#8221; (keeping with Zigbee and the <span class="caps">AT</span> command set) in  &#8220;Function set&#8221; the drop-down, then select the most recent version of this function set from the &#8220;Version&#8221; drop-down. (Versions are identified by hex numbers: the most recent in the screenshot right is &#8220;20A7&#8221;, that being the highest hex number. Unfortunately X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> orders the numbers alphabetically, not in hex-numeric order.) Pressing &#8220;Write&#8221; will update the radio&#8217;s firmware, and the radio is then ready for use as a co-ordinator.

If you look through the list of function sets, there will be quite a few options, including protocols other than Zigbee. These probably aren&#8217;t worth too much exploration, but you&#8217;ll also notice that there are Zigbee <span class="caps">AT</span> and <span class="caps">API</span> function sets corresponding to the <a href="../2013/07/01/xbee/" target="_blank">two modes (transparent and <span class="caps">API</span>)</a> that the XBee can support. Be sure to select the correct one for your application.

That&#8217;s it: the radio is now ready for&nbsp;use.
</p>
<h3>Advanced use: setting optional&nbsp;parameters</h3>
There&#8217;s one more thing that X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> can be used for: it can set parameters to the firmware function set, and this is sometimes important when using the radios.

![X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> parameter setting](/images/citizen-sensing/xctu-parameter-setting.png)

When you&#8217;ve read the firmware from a radio, the main part of the X-<span class="caps">CTU</span> window contains a hierarchy of folders and cryptic values, for example &#8220;(4) <span class="caps">PL</span> - Power level&#8221;. These are parameters that can be changed to modify the detailed behaviour of the radio. Some can also be set using <span class="caps">AT</span> commands. The example we used sets the radio&#8217;s power level to 4. If you click on this, it will show a drop-down box giving other options. You might, for some applications, choose to reduce the radio power to 1 (&#8220;low&#8221;) to save batteries. If you choose this and then write the firmware to the radio, the module will use this power setting.

In the example shown on the left, we&#8217;re changing the <span class="caps">AP</span> parameter (&#8220;<span class="caps">API</span> enable&#8221;) to 2, which is needed for the <a href="../2013/07/03/xbee-arduino" target="_blank">xbee-arduino library</a> to work properly. If we now write the firmware (with the Zigbee co-ordinator <span class="caps">API</span> function set selected as shown), the radio will be ready for use.

Herbert Stoyan.  <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/800055.802047">Early Lisp History (1956–1959)</a></i>. In <i><span class="caps">LFP</span> ’84:
Proceedings of the 1984 <span class="caps">ACM</span> Symposium on Lisp and Functional
Programming</i>, pp.299–310.&nbsp;1984.
</p>

<p>
A study of Lisp&#8217;s evolution from first proposal to practical&nbsp;implementation.
</p>

<p>
It begins with McCarthy&#8217;s proposal (co-authored with Marvin
Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, and dated 31
August 1955) for a summer research project at Dartmouth College to
&#8220;study the relationship of language to&nbsp;intelligence&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
In a later (handwritten!) note McCarthy homed-in on the core
challenges in this programme: the lack of a clear way to describe
<i>procedures</i> to each other (what <a href="https://simondobson.org/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/">Abelson and Sussman</a> later refer to
as <i>procedural epistemology</i>), and the tight binding of programming
systems at that time to specific machines, and hence their need to
bow to engineering (rather than semantic) considerations. The
language that became Lisp sought primarily to overcome these two&nbsp;challenges.
</p>

<p>
The journey proceeded by taking the list data structures developed
by Allen Newell and Herb Simon as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist">Logic Theorist</a> and
embedding them into <span class="caps">FORTRAN</span> (for which there was already a working
compiler) – which also incidentally muddied the conceptual waters
by trying to express list and list-functional concepts in a
language built around numbers that barely allowed functions to be
defined by the user at all. Indeed, McCarthy and others had
long-running problems accepting that the list-processing functions
<i>were</i> functions, given that their result does not depend solely on
their arguments when viewed at the lowest level. This shows how
pernicious a low-level implementation can be. The final resulting
language, the <span class="caps">FORTRAN</span> List Processing Language (<span class="caps">FLPL</span>), shared many
programming approaches function names with what became&nbsp;Lisp.
</p>

<p>
McCarthy went on to champion the functional approach, including
the invention of conditional expressions (alongside or replacing
conditional statements) and the power of the different kinds of
function composition and higher-order functions. It&#8217;s important to
remember that McCarthy&#8217;s driving interest remained in <span class="caps">AI</span>, not
programming languages <i>per se</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Already in 1956 it was clear that one had to work with symbolic
expressions to reach the goal of artificial&nbsp;intelligence.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Which is a fascinating piece of history in itself, as a large
branch of modern <span class="caps">AI</span> concerning machine learning and large language
models has explicit rejects this view in favour of sub-symbolic
<span class="caps">AI</span>. Which approach is &#8220;correct&#8221; in whatever sense remains to be&nbsp;seen.
</p>

<p>
But it remains McCarthy&#8217;s contributions to programming languages
that stand out. As well as conditional expressions he can be
credited with garbage collection, meta-circular interpretation,
and clarifying the relationship between programming and&nbsp;proof:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We should mention here that McCarthy at the same time conceived the
idea of logic-oriented programming, that is, the idea of using logical
formulae to express goals that a program should try to establish and
of using the prover as programming language&nbsp;interpreter.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Although it&#8217;s important to recognise that Newell and Simon&#8217;s
work, on logic as an application rather than as a general
programming language, pre-dates&nbsp;McCarthy&#8217;s.)

Includes a history of the route from <span class="caps">PLANNER</span> to <span class="caps">CONNIVER</span>, in which
the former was criticised for being a theorem prover when a
programming language was needed – an argument between two schools

Laboratory, Stanford University.&nbsp;1979.
</p>

<p>
McCarthy&#8217;s own take on the early history. It&#8217;s quite brief, but is
very careful to give broad credit to the others who were involved
in the practical creation of the&nbsp;language.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s also got some great vignettes on <i>why</i> certain features came
about - for example garbage collection coming from the need to
clean up intermediate structures when experimenting with symbolic
differentiation. McCarthy acknowledges taking the notation for
functions from Church, before admitting that he didn&#8217;t understand
the rest of <i>Calculi of lambda conversion</i> and so wasn&#8217;t tempted to
add the more general&nbsp;aspects!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most fascinating part of the story is that it was
originally so divorced from actual computers. The team had defined&nbsp;an <code>eval</code> function for interpreting Lisp programs – in the process
making the decision to represent the programs as lists – before
realising that this could be made interactive to provide a running&nbsp;interpreter.
</p>

<p>
What did McCarthy think of his creation? He was conscious that it
would have a&nbsp;lifetime:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="caps">LISP</span> will become obsolete when someone makes a more comprehensive
language that dominates <span class="caps">LISP</span> practically and also gives a clear
mathematical semantics to a more comprehensive set of&nbsp;features.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Haskell has a plausible claim to have accomplished the latter but
this doesn&#8217;t seem to have led domination in&nbsp;practice.

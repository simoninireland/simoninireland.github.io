Could social media posts be actively damaging to our mental health?
– literally, not just figuratively? That&#8217;s the premise of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/09/techscape-deepfakes-cognitohazards-science-fiction">a
TechScape article in The Guardian</a>, that draws on both science
fiction and psychological&nbsp;research.
</p>

<p>
In Neal Stephenson&#8217;s &#8220;Snow crash&#8221; there is a plot device of an image
in a metaverse that, when viewed, crashes the viewer&#8217;s brain. We
haven&#8217;t seen this in social media (yet), but there&#8217;s an increasing
concern about deepfake images and other forms of misinformation.
Research suggests that such images are damaging <i>even if viewers
know that they&#8217;re fakes</i>, which suggests that techniques like
content-labelling images as <span class="caps">AI</span>-generated are insufficient to remove
their harm. Other examples include massively engaging artificial
images such as the &#8220;pong wars&#8221; animation of two simultaneous
&#8220;Breakout&#8221; games going on between two algorithms: something that
shouldn&#8217;t be as engaging as it is (as I can attest to&nbsp;myself).
</p>

<p>
Social media attention grabbing at an industrial scale might
therefore constitute a <i>cognitohazard</i>, a way of hacking people&#8217;s
brains simply by being&nbsp;viewed.

Mark Watson.  <i><a href="https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp">Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer’s Secret
Weapon</a></i>. Leanpub.&nbsp;2023.
</p>

<p>
While pitched as a way of sharing the author&#8217;s enthusiasm for Lisp
(which really shines through), this book is really a deep
demonstration in using Lisp in modern applications – from web
APIs and the semantic web to deep learning, large language models,
and&nbsp;chatbots.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, like many other Lisp books, it&#8217;s really two books in
one. The first chapters are introductory – and to be perfectly
honest could be dispensed with, as they&#8217;re inadequate as a proper
introduction and there are far better introductions out there. The
later chapters focus on applications, and provide the real value.
One could criticise them as often tying-together tools in other
languages, with the Lisp code basically being glue; but that&#8217;s a
very effective way of leveraging all the code and services out
there, and is an important technique for Lisp programmers&nbsp;too.

<a href="https://corecursive.com/lisp-in-space-with-ron-garret/">Lisp in space</a> (podcast, 38&nbsp;minutes)
</p>

<p>
An interview on the Corecursive podcast with Ron&nbsp;Garret.
</p>

<p>
In 1988 (when, for context, I was in the second year of my BSc)
Garret started working on autonomous navigation software for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_(rover)">Sojourner</a>, <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s first Mars rover, which flew in 1997. He used Lisp
to do planning, essentially developing an entire domain-specific
language for autonomous vehicles. The project was never flown, as
<span class="caps">NASA</span> opted for a far less ambitious approach to driving to rovers –
a decision that Garret now considers to have been the correct&nbsp;one.
</p>

<p>
But that isn&#8217;t the end of the story, because Garret then went on
to develop an autonomous Remote Agent controller for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_1">Deep
Space 1</a> technology demonstration mission that performed asteroid
and comet fly-bys. Without spoiling to story, the spacecraft flies
with a full Lisp system onboard, and Garret gets to interact with
its <span class="caps">REPL</span> at a distance of 30 light-minutes <i>via</i> the Deep Space
Network – surely the longest latency of any <span class="caps">REPL</span> session&nbsp;ever!
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s an fascinating insight into both the potentials of Lisp and
the political difficulties that using a non-standard development
language can&nbsp;engender.

Programmers</a></i>. Leanpub.&nbsp;2013.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m not convinced by the sub-title: at the very least, there&#8217;s no
evidence to support the claim that Lisp programmers really are
hundreds of time more productive. But there are some serious
insights here from individuals who&#8217;ve made serious contributions
to the Lisp world – and beyond. The contributions all take the
form of email interviews consisting of a standard prelude of
questions (how did you discover Lisp?, do you use it at work?)
followed by a couple of questions tailored to the&nbsp;interviewee.
</p>

<p>
The practitioners selected have all been affected by Lisp, either
in terms of it changing their own thought processes, or by helping
to develop the core ecosystem, or by applying Lisp to real-world
problems, and often to great effect. My favourite was the
discussion with someone who was using Common Lisp to develop
low-latency network routing for financial services: it&#8217;s hard
to think of a better example of Lisp&#8217;s power and&nbsp;range.

</p>

<p>
The never-dull Richard Stallman talks about his experiences with
Lisp and with the development of Emacs. It&#8217;s got some useful
observations on <i>why</i> Lisp became the core of Emacs: it was news to
me that this hadn&#8217;t always been the case. It started with an
&#8220;editor control&#8221; language in the spirit of editors&nbsp;like <code>ed</code>. But as
people wanted more support from their editor, they wanted to
program it more&nbsp;effectively.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The language that you build your extensions on shouldn&#8217;t be
thought of as a programming language in afterthought; it should be
designed as a programming language. In fact, we discovered that
the best programming language for that purpose was&nbsp;Lisp.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The result was a re-write of Emacs in C (for portability), with a
Lisp interpreter specialised towards editing&nbsp;tasks.
</p>

<p>
He then gives an insider&#8217;s perspective on the Lisp machines and
their evolution, as well as revealing the genesis of his ideas for
the free software movement. While these are interesting to read,
it should be noted that much of it has been rebutted: his
description of the formation and later history of the two
spin-outs, Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc, is strongly disputed
by Dan Weinreb on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090101103828/http://danweinreb.org/blog/rebuttal-to-stallmans-story-about-the-formation-of-symbolics-and-lmi">his blog</a>.)

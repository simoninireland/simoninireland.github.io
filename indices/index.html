      Post-apocalyptic fiction of a determinedly British kind. It&#8217;s not a bad book, and has a certain complexity to it in exploring how people&#8217;s attitudes might change when faced with the destruction of normal civilisation.<br><br>A deadly virus destroys all grass-like plants, thereby eliminating almost all food crops and the cattle that they feed. Worried the government might atom-bomb the major population centres, a small group leave London to make their way to a Lake District valley. On the way they encounter looters, towns gone feral to protect themselves – and become feral themselves, willing to kill to survive. In some ways it reads like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies" title="Lord of the Flies by William Golding" rel="nofollow noopener">Lord of the Flies</a> with adults and a more pervading sense of long-term doom.<br><br>But it&#8217;s also very much a novel of its time, full of racism, sexism, classism, deference, stiff upper lips, and a sense of self-justification wrapped-up as duty. That makes it a hard read, and it doesn&#8217;t really have enough force to balance that out. Manu similar points are made elsewhere, for example in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93269.Earth_Abides" title="Earth Abides by George R.

<h2 id="orgd98d7d7">Trying to refute some criticisms of&nbsp;Lisp</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd98d7d7">
<p>
I recently had a discussion with someone on Mastodon about Lisp and
its perceived (by them) deficiencies as a language. There were some
interesting points, but I felt I had to try to refute them, at least&nbsp;partially.
</p>

<p>
I should say from the start the I&#8217;m not blind to Lisp&#8217;s many
inadequacies and anachronisms, merely pointing out that it has a
context like everything&nbsp;else.
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be two main&nbsp;issues:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Poor design decisions throughout, and especially a lack of static&nbsp;typing</li>
<li>The shadows of really early machines&nbsp;in <code>car</code> and <code>cadr</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These points are tied together, but let&#8217;s try to unpack&nbsp;them.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org56c411b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org56c411b">Design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org56c411b">
<p>
Let&#8217;s start with design. Lisp is over half a century old. I&#8217;d argue
it was exceptionally well-designed – when it was designed. It
lacks most modern advances in types because … well, they didn&#8217;t
exist, many of them arose as solutions to perceived problems in
Lisp (and Fortran), and many of those &#8220;solutions&#8221; still aren&#8217;t
universally accepted, such as static typing&nbsp;itself.
</p>

<p>
What we&#8217;ve actually learned is that many aspects of programming
lack any really universal solutions. If static typing were such an
obvious and unarguable route to efficiency and quality, all new
software would be being written in&nbsp;Haskell.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org55c3fc3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org55c3fc3">Typing and&nbsp;features</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org55c3fc3">
<p>
And the lack of modern types isn&#8217;t really as clear-cut as it
appears. The argument about the <i>lack</i> of features in Lisp also
ignores the <i>presence</i> of other features that are absent from
almost all other&nbsp;languages.
</p>

<p>
Lisp&#8217;s numeric types are surprisingly flexible. Indeed, Common Lisp
is still, in the 21st century, just about the only language in
which one can write modern crypto algorithms like Diffie-Hellman
key exchange without recourse to additional libraries, because it
has arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic built-in to the standard
operators. It also has rational numbers, so no loss of precision on
division&nbsp;either.
</p>

<p>
The Common Lisp Object System (<span class="caps">CLOS</span>) is vastly more flexible than
<i>any</i> modern object-oriented language. Sub-class methods can
specify their relationship with the methods they override, such as
being called after or just filtering the return values. Methods
themselves are multiple-dispatch and so can be selected based on
the types of their arguments as well as their target. The basic
mechanisms can be overridden or extended using a meta-object&nbsp;protocol.
</p>

<p>
Then there are macros. It&#8217;s easy to underestimate these: after all,
C has macros, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, yes – and no. A C macro is a
function from strings to strings that can do literal string
substitution of its arguments. A Lisp macro is a function from code
to code that can perform arbitrary computation. They&#8217;re really not
the same things at all, and it&#8217;s misleading that the same word is
used for both. (C++ templates are a closer analogy, but still
limited in&nbsp;comparison.)
</p>

<h3 id="orgf6bd10f">The persistence of hardware 1: Stupid operation&nbsp;names</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf6bd10f">
<p>
The complaints&nbsp;about <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are long established: they
were originally derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR_and_CDR">machine-language instructions on the
<span class="caps">IBM</span> 704</a> that was used for the first Lisp implementations. They&#8217;re
a terrible hold-over from that terrible decision … aren&#8217;t&nbsp;they?
</p>

<p>
Well, yes – and no. Of course they&#8217;re terrible in one sense.&nbsp;But
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are basically nouns as far as Lisp programmers are
concerned. One could replace them with more modern usages&nbsp;like
<code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> (and indeed many Lisps define these using&nbsp;macros).
</p>

<p>
But it&#8217;s important to remember that even &#8220;head&#8221; and &#8220;tail&#8221; are
analogies, sanctified by familiarity in the computer science
literature but still inexplicable to anyone outside. (If you doubt
that, try explaining to someone who isn&#8217;t a programmer that a
shopping list has a &#8220;head&#8221; consisting of the first entry, and a
&#8220;tail&#8221; consisting of another, shorter, shopping list, is &#8220;in fact&#8221;
a recursive type, and you have to acquire each item of shopping
sequentially by working your way down the list from the&nbsp;head.)
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are artificial nouns,&nbsp;and <code>cons</code> is an artificial
verb – but really no more artificial&nbsp;that <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>,&nbsp;and
<code>append</code>, their rough equivalents in other&nbsp;languages.
</p>

<p>
One can argue that the persistence&nbsp;of <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> drives the
persistence of compounds&nbsp;like <code>caaddr</code>. But those are unnecessary
and seldom used: barely anyone would mind if they were&nbsp;removed.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org877de7f">The persistence of hardware 2: It happens a&nbsp;lot</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org877de7f">
<p>
The suggestion that Lisp has hardware holdovers that should be
removed also neglects these holdovers in other&nbsp;languages.
</p>

<p>
As an example, check the definition&nbsp;of <code>std::memcpy</code> in C++. It
doesn&#8217;t work with overlapping memory areas. Why is that? – why is
it so fast, but so dangerous? Does it relate to underlying machine
features, such as machine code move instructions on particular
machines with particular restrictions? Doesn&#8217;t this introduce the
risk of security flaws like buffer&nbsp;overruns?
</p>

<p>
Languages with more abstracted machine models don&#8217;t have these
issues. I struggle to think of how one could even introduce the
<i>concept</i> of a buffer overrun into Lisp, other than by using some
external raw-memory-access library: the language itself is immune,
as far as I&nbsp;know.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org96431c6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org96431c6">The different&nbsp;choices</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org96431c6">
<p>
For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s turn the argument around and ask:
give that early Lisps had proper macros, arbitrary-precision
integers, and so on, why did these features disappear from what we
now consider to be &#8220;the mainstream&#8221; of programming language&nbsp;design?
</p>

<p>
Lisp&#8217;s designers had a goal of building a powerful machine in which
to think: indeed, they intended it to eventually have its own
hardware designed specifically for it to run on. They therefore
didn&#8217;t buy into the necessity of immediate performance, and as
their applications were largely symbolic <span class="caps">AI</span> they didn&#8217;t need
numerical performance at all. They chose instead to create high-level
constructs even if these couldn&#8217;t be compiled efficiently, and
explored using these to create more code as they identified more
and more abstract patterns whose details could be automated away.
(Paul Graham has <a href="https://paulgraham.com/diff.html">a great essay</a> on&nbsp;this.)
</p>

<p>
Other language designers had other priorities. Often they needed to
do numerical simulation, and needed both performance and scale. So
they chose a different design pathway, emphasising efficient
compilation to the hardware they had available, and made the
compromises needed to get it. These have persisted, and that&#8217;s why
we have languages with fixed-width integers scaled to fit into a
single machine register, and compilers that generate – but don&#8217;t
directly execute – the code of programs, which limits our ability
to abstract and automate code generation without recourse to
complicated external&nbsp;tools.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s interesting to explore these choices. They&#8217;re at one level
&#8220;just&#8221; historical: accidents that shaped the present. But at
another level they&#8217;re still very much present in the hardware and
software landscape we inhabit. I think it&#8217;s important that we
remind ourselves, continuously, that <i>much of that landscape is a
choice</i>, not a given, and one we can question and change as we&nbsp;wish.

</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2db2af5">
<p>
I decided recently I wanted to have a more controlled email setup,
with a local archive rather than relying on remote servers
to keep everything. The point of this is&nbsp;twofold:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>To have a local archive of email, separate from the corporate
servers in case I need to change provider&nbsp;etc</li>
<li>To use different MUAs locally, rather than being stuck with only
a few that will work with all the providers and that are clunky
and not well-integrated with my&nbsp;workflow</li>
</ol>
<p>
There&#8217;s a lot of outdated information on the web about how to set
this up and it took some time for me to get a working setup, so I
thought I&#8217;d share my experience. Specifically this involves
interfacing command-line email receiving and sending to a Microsoft
Office365 server using <span class="caps">IMAP</span> and <span class="caps">SMTP</span> with corporate-grade <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> <span class="caps">2FA</span>
authentication: it&#8217;s the last part that&#8217;s tricky. As a bonus the
same approach also works for <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> and Gmail, dispensing with
insecure application&nbsp;passwords.
</p>

<p>
In case it&#8217;s not obvious by now, this is a hacker set-up that
requires quite a lot of technical manual&nbsp;configuration.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgc164d4a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc164d4a">How the internet email architecture&nbsp;works</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc164d4a">
<p>
The old-school approach to email involves several elements, each
potentially provided by a different&nbsp;tool:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a client program or <i>mail user agent</i> (<span class="caps">MUA</span>) that presents email
to you and lets you search, delete, store,&nbsp;etc;</li>
<li>a retrieval program or <i>mail delivery agent</i> (<span class="caps">MDA</span>) that retrieves
mail from the providers and manages local email&nbsp;directories</li>
<li>a sending program or <i>mail transfer agent</i> (<span class="caps">MTA</span>) that takes; and
locally-created messages and transfer them to their intended&nbsp;recipients.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Modern <span class="caps">GUI</span> email clients like Thunderbird typically wrap-up all
three services into one program that&#8217;s easier to deploy and manage,
but that therefore forces certain choices on the user. By reverting
to the older architecture we regain flexibility and choice, at the
expense of making our lives&nbsp;harder.
</p>

<p>
All these tools need to authenticate against other services.
Traditionally this used usernames and passwords, which are clearly
inadequate for the modern web. Instead we need a system based
around stronger&nbsp;encryption.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth"><span class="caps">OAUTH2</span></a> is a an authorisation delegation protocol that lets a site
grant access to someone who&#8217;s authenticated against another,
without getting sight of their credentials. The typical use case is
for a web site to allow users to sign-in using social media
services like Facebook or Google, which reduces the number of
passwords a user needs to remember or manage – and, totally
incidentally I&#8217;m sure, improves the social media services&#8217; ability
to track users&#8217; activities across the&nbsp;web.
</p>

<p>
In our case, the <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> &#8220;flow&#8221; interacts with the authentication
provider and acquires a bearer token that can then be presented to
authorise access to the various email&nbsp;services.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org10aa51a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org10aa51a">Outline&nbsp;solution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org10aa51a">
<p>
In outline the solution is as&nbsp;follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Install <code>mbsync</code> as&nbsp;<span class="caps">MDA</span></li>
<li>Set up <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> authentication for&nbsp;Office365</li>
<li>Use the to&nbsp;authenticate <code>mbsync</code> against Office365 to allow&nbsp;retrieval</li>
<li>Install <code>msmtp</code> as <span class="caps">MTA</span>, using the same authentication&nbsp;scheme</li>
<li>Install <code>mu4e</code> as <span class="caps">MUA</span>, since I want to read my email from inside&nbsp;Emacs</li>

<h3 id="org3996aef">Packages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3996aef">
<p>
Under Arch Linux we need&nbsp;the <code>isync</code> package for synchronisation
and&nbsp;the <code>cyrus-sasl-xoauth2</code> provider for <span class="caps">OAUTH</span>&nbsp;authentication.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   sudo pacman -S isync
   yay -S cyrus-sasl-xoauth2
</pre></div>

<p>
The same packages are available for other distros under similar
names. Note that the actual synchronisation tool is&nbsp;called
<code>mbsync</code>, even though the package that contains it is&nbsp;called
<code>isync</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1678620" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1678620"><span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> flow&nbsp;management</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1678620">
<p>
We want to use <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> to authenticate an <span class="caps">IMAP</span> transaction, so that
no additional passwords are needed. To this we need a script to
manage the <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span>&nbsp;flow.
</p>

<p>
Weirdly for an operation that&#8217;s becoming so common on the web,
there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a package that offers <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> from the
command line. However, there <i>is</i> a script that does it that&#8217;s
included as an example with&nbsp;the <code>mutt</code> <span class="caps">MUA</span>, and we can use that. It
can be found (in Arch) in&nbsp;the <code>mutt</code> package.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   sudo pacman -S mutt
   cp /usr/share/doc/mutt/samples/mutt_oauth2.py .
</pre></div>

<p>
This puts a copy of the script into the current directory, which we
can then edit in two&nbsp;ways:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>add the internal application identification and client secrets
for accessing Office365;&nbsp;and</li>
<li>set up the security for the <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> access tokens when they&#8217;re
downloaded and held&nbsp;locally.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The client secret and app id need to be &#8220;proper&#8221;, in the sense that
Office365 knows about them – but weirdly they <i>don&#8217;t</i> have to be
related to your email domain or cloud tenancy. It&#8217;s perfectly fine
to use credentials available in the public domain, for example
those of&nbsp;Thunderbird:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">AppID</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"08162f7c-0fd2-4200-a84a-f25a4db0b584"</span>
   <span class="n">ClientSecret</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"TxRBilcHdC6WGBee]fs?QR:SJ8nI[g82"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
(I got these from <a href="https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jacobd/posts/2022/03/configure-mutt-to-work-with-oauth-20/">here</a>, but other than that have no idea where
they come from: they&#8217;re <i>not</i> the same as those in the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/file/tip/mailnews/base/src/OAuth2Providers.jsm">Thunderbird source code</a>, as far as I can&nbsp;tell.)
</p>

<p>
The <code>mutt_oauth2.py</code> script stores the tokens it manages in&nbsp;a
<code>gpg</code>-encrypted file. You therefore need to provide&nbsp;your <code>gpg</code>
keypair identification, and I&#8217;m assuming anyone wanting to get
local email has one of those! Mine is&nbsp;&#8220;simoninireland&#8221;.

<p>
Put resulting script&nbsp;into <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and make it executable.
Then run it in &#8220;authorisation&#8221; mode. The token file can go
anywhere: I put it in the directory used&nbsp;by <code>pass</code> to allow for an
alternative access&nbsp;route:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   mutt_oauth2.py -t .password-store/email/work.gpg --authorize
</pre></div>

<p>
This will ask some&nbsp;questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we want &#8220;microsoft&#8221;&nbsp;authentication</li>
<li>and a &#8220;localhostauthcode&#8221;&nbsp;flow</li>
<li>enter your email address (the actual user, not any&nbsp;alias)</li>
</ul>
<p>
and it prints out a <span class="caps">URL</span> to copy into a browser to authenticate
against Office365&#8217;s web interface. In my case this involved
interacting with the university&#8217;s single sign-on and two-factor
authentication (<span class="caps">2FA</span>) system. Doing this successfully put the
necessary <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> tokens, encrypted, into the specified file.&nbsp;Running:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   mutt_oauth2.py -t .password-store/email/work.gpg
</pre></div>

<p>
will output the token, refreshing it automatically if it&#8217;s
expired. This may ask for the <span class="caps">GPG</span> key&#8217;s passphrase, if it has one,
and if it&#8217;s not available from a local key&nbsp;agent.
</p>

<p>
(All this security means that the bearer tokens are stored
encryoted at rest. It&#8217;s a little inconvenient, though, as it means
you need to enter&nbsp;a <code>gpg</code> passphrase periodically, and makes it
hard to&nbsp;run <code>mbsync</code> in&nbsp;a <code>cron</code> job. This is fine if, like me,
your level of security paranoia is such that you accept the minor
inconvenience in exchange for not having plain-text access tokens
lying around; on the other hand, you may decide that using, for
example, a machine with full-disc encryption is secure enough, in
which case you need to edit&nbsp;the <code>ENCRYPTION_PIPE</code> and
<code>DECRYPTION_PIPE</code> commands in the script to not do encryption: they
can basically just&nbsp;use <code>cat</code> to store and retrieve the token&nbsp;information.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc6f2fdb">
<p>
We now have <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> tokens for accessing Office365, which we can
integrate with our&nbsp;<span class="caps">MDA</span>. <code>mbsync</code> has four main&nbsp;concepts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Accounts, typically using&nbsp;<span class="caps">IMAP</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">IMAP</span> message stores, which are&nbsp;remote</li>

<li>Channels, which tie local and remote&nbsp;together</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir">Maildir</a> is a file format for storing email in a directory
structure, and is a long-running standard that&#8217;s supported by lots
of tools. A maildir is typically presented in the <span class="caps">MUA</span> to a user as
a folder, and represented to the <span class="caps">MDA</span> as a&nbsp;directory.
</p>

<p>
For Office365 we&nbsp;have:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   IMAPAccount work

<p>
(See&nbsp;the <code>mbsync</code> man pages for the details of its&nbsp;configuration.
<code>&lt;&lt;work-email&gt;&gt;</code> should be a a proper username, not an alias.)
For our purposes the important line is&nbsp;the <code>PassCmd</code> that calls our
edited script to retrieve the <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> bearer token. Email will be
downloaded into a maildir tree rooted&nbsp;at <code>~/Maildir/Work</code>: you need
to create this before&nbsp;sync-ing.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   mkdir -p ~/Maildir/Work

<p>
That can be time-consuming, as all the maildirs (<i>i.e.</i>, folders)
have to be visited – and I have several hundred. A faster
option is to normally just look at (for example) the&nbsp;inbox:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   mbsync Work:INBOX

<p>
This will ignore everything else, which means they&#8217;ll drift – but
can be re-sync&#8217;ed periodically by running a full sync. One could
also set up&nbsp;a <code>cron</code> job to do a full sync early every morning, for
example, as long as the access token was held unencrypted (see&nbsp;above).

<h3 id="org7a295f7">Indexing&nbsp;email</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7a295f7">
<p>
You&#8217;ll almost certainly now want to index your newly-downloaded
trove of messages. There are two common tools for&nbsp;this <code>mu</code> and
<code>notmuch</code>. Both do basically the same job of maintaining a
structured and full-text index of messages that can be queried by
an appropriate <span class="caps">MUA</span>. I&nbsp;chose <code>mu</code>, for no particular reason: some
people swear&nbsp;by <code>notmuch</code>, which is based on extensive tagging of
messages and so might be more familiar to Gmail&nbsp;users.
</p>

<p>
To&nbsp;install <code>mu</code>, we first grab the&nbsp;package:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   pacman -S mu
</pre></div>

<p>
We then initialise the index by running the indexer over the
maildir. If we also provide our own email address (or more than one) it knows to
index these&nbsp;differently.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   mu init -m ~/Maildir --my-address=&lt;&lt;work-email&gt;&gt;

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4da7e8a">

All of the above sets up the <span class="caps">MDA</span> to <i>get</i> mail: we now need to be
able to <i>send</i> mail. Fortunately we&#8217;ve already done most of the
hard work needed to get this&nbsp;working.
</p>

<p>
We need a local <span class="caps">MTA</span>, for which I&nbsp;chose <code>msmtp</code>. It understands
<span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> natively. Installation in Arch is&nbsp;easy:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   sudo pacman -S msmtp
</pre></div>

<p>
It needs to be pointed at the Office365 <span class="caps">SMTP</span> server and provided
with the <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span> tokens, which are the same as we used&nbsp;above:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   defaults
   auth           on
   tls            on
   tls_starttls   on
   tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
   logfile        ~/.msmtp.log

   account        work
   host           smtp.office365.com
   port           587
   auth           xoauth2
   user           &lt;&lt;work-email&gt;&gt;
   from           &lt;&lt;work-email&gt;&gt;
   passwordeval   "mutt_oauth2.py -t ~/.password-store/email/work.gpg"

   account default : work
</pre></div>

<p>
Again, see&nbsp;the <code>msmtp</code> man pages for the details of this, and&nbsp;replace <code>&lt;&lt;work-email&gt;&gt;</code> as appropriate: the only interesting part
from our current perspective is that&nbsp;the <code>passwordeval</code> line calls
exactly the same script as we used&nbsp;above.

Finally we&#8217;re ready to read email. I&#8217;ll leave this to you: there
are lots of text-based email clients around, notably <a href="http://www.mutt.org/"><code>mutt</code></a> that we
encountered earlier. There&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html"><code>mu4e</code></a> for reading email in
Emacs, making use of&nbsp;the <code>mu</code> index; and <a href="https://notmuch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man1/notmuch.html"><code>notmuch</code></a> also has <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">an

</p>

<p>
I&nbsp;use <code>mu4e</code>. There&#8217;s a lot of documentation on the web for setting
this up, all of which applies immediately to our new set-up: the
<span class="caps">MUA</span> is entirely independent of the <span class="caps">MDA</span> and <span class="caps">MTA</span>, and simply needs to

Gmail lets one use &#8220;app passwords&#8221; for accessing using <span class="caps">IMAP</span>, but
also supports <span class="caps">OAUTH2</span>, which is obviously more secure. The same

(<a href="https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jacobd/posts/2022/03/configure-mutt-to-work-with-oauth-20/">Same source</a> as above.) Edit these into the script and change the
entries in the config files to call it to authenticate with an
appropriate store, for&nbsp;example:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   mutt_oauth2.py -t .password-store/email/personal.gpg --authorize

If you&#8217;re still with me: congratulations, but you must <i>really</i>

<p>
For me, this has completely changed my relationship with email in
ways I didn&#8217;t expect. Using Emacs means typically not having the
client visible all the time, which reduces the temptation to check
all the time. Instead I can adopt a more structured approach and
only check my email when I want to, which often means only three or
four times a day. It&#8217;s also made email easier to manage, for
example by adding hyperlinks in my to-do list straight to messages
that need attention, and adding some integrations with org mode to
simplify email processing. Those are matters for another time,&nbsp;though.

</p>

<p>
Hard to know whether to include this as an introduction or
collection of applications, since it runs all the way from basic
uses to pattern-matching and associative retrieval, by way of the
non-list data types in Lisp, and includes discussion of the symbol
table and other internals that definitely fall into the &#8220;advanced&#8221;&nbsp;category.
</p>

<p>
However, this was my second introduction to Lisp (after <a href="/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/"><span class="caps">SICP</span></a>), so
it has a fond place in my memory. The fact that it deals with
language internals isn&#8217;t a bad thing, because it deals with the
basics so well. It&#8217;s very much a traditional programming
introduction focusing on the &#8220;needed&#8221; parts of the language. It
pre-dates the Common Lisp standard and doesn&#8217;t touch on <span class="caps">CLOS</span>,
which perhaps make it a less appropriate choice for newcomers
these days than <a href="/2024/01/27/practical-common-lisp/">Practical Common Lisp</a>.

Manual</a></i>. Technical report <span class="caps">AIM</span>-259a. <span class="caps">MIT</span> <span class="caps">AI</span> Laboratory.&nbsp;1974.
</p>

<p>
I think Conniver may have a claim to being the most influential
language you&#8217;ve never heard of. It&#8217;s a mostly forgotten Lisp
variant that was a laboratory for some radically different
language design ideas, and a precursor to a surprising set of
features – many of which are still uncommon in the&nbsp;mainstream.
</p>

<p>
Conniver was intended to manage knowledge databases. This does
make the report slightly hard to read in places, as there are a
lot of explicit references to planning techniques wrapped-up with
language mechanisms that don&#8217;t really depend on&nbsp;them.
</p>

<p>
Conniver is (to the best of my knowledge) the first appearance of
<b>generators</b> in a programming language. It is therefore a distant
precursor of all the lazy functional languages and libraries, as
well as the generators found in Python. Implementing generators
<i>within</i> a language (rather than as a built-in part of one)
requires control structures that can be exited and re-entered, and
therefore needs more flexible frames for controlling executing
code rather than conventional stack frames that are unwound
destructively on&nbsp;return.
</p>

<p>
The obvious (for Lisp, anyway) next step is to make these &#8220;hairy&#8221;
control structures visible within the language, to allow them to
be re-arranged in interesting ways. It does this by exposing the
structure of frames, consisting&nbsp;of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the bound&nbsp;variables</li>
<li>the state of the ongoing computation within the frame (<i>e.g.</i>,
the program&nbsp;counter)</li>
<li>a link&nbsp;(the <code>ALINK</code>) to the frame within which free variables
should be&nbsp;looked-up</li>
<li>a link&nbsp;(the <code>CLINK</code>) to the frame to which control should return
on exit from the&nbsp;frame</li>
</ul>
<p>
This structure in turn mandates the use of <b>spaghetti stack</b> (or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent_pointer_tree">parent pointer trees</a>) where frames are implemented using lists
that can be combined in richer ways than actual, literal stacks.
Thee are the underpinnings of several different common&nbsp;structures:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>generators and&nbsp;continuations</li>
<li>closures</li>
<li>non-local transfers,&nbsp;like <code>CATCH</code> and <code>THROW</code> in Common Lisp, and
therefore probably encompassing the entire condition&nbsp;system</li>
<li>functions with access to extra state (as with object methods,
but in this case used as callbacks for database&nbsp;updates)</li>
<li>symbolic debuggers (not mentioned in the&nbsp;text)</li>
<li>lexical <i>versus</i> dynamic variable scope (not mentioned in the
text, and I think it&#8217;s a binary choice between one or the other
depending on&nbsp;the <code>ALINK</code>, rather than accommodating lexical and
&#8220;special&#8221; variable classes as Common Lisp&nbsp;does)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So these features are constructed in Conniver from more basic
mechanisms rather than being provided built-in. I&#8217;m fascinated by
what other structures one might build when every frame has <i>two</i>
independent super-frames (one for variable lookup,one for control
return) instead of one, and both can be modified independently.
This is radically different to most languages in which frames are
hidden and their manipulation reserved for the compiler and
run-time: it&#8217;s a set of ideas that re-surface at the object level
in metaobject&nbsp;protocols.

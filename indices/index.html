      I have very mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand it&#8217;s a triumph of computational experimental technique, taking an idea that was well-known (cellular automata) and subjecting it to rigorous exploration. This uncovers a lot of new science, not least showing that complex systems can arise from even the simplest set of rules, but also that this complexity falls into classes that show graded complexity depending purely on the fine structure of the initial conditions. That&#8217;s a massively important discovery.<br><br>On the other hand&#8230;. It&#8217;s hard to describe this as a &#8220;new kind&#8221; of science. &#8220;New science,&#8221; yes, but not indicative of a new paradigm or <i>way</i> of doing science, other than by emphasising the structured use of simulation. Wolfram completely over-sells what he&#8217;s achieved, making claims he can&#8217;t substantiate to aggrandise his own contributions. And that&#8217;s a shame, not least because it&#8217;s so <i>unnecessary</i>: Wolfram has made some important discoveries, both here and to several other branches of physics and computer science, as well as popularising computational methods and tools. It&#8217;s tragic that he doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to appreciate himself as being sufficient.<br><br>The book is also quite terribly written, being almost half-composed of footnotes, meaning a reader is constantly skipping forwards and back: difficult in print, and I suspect impossible in a digital edition unless it&#8217;s been very carefully hyperlinked. And the footnotes are often important! – indeed, they often provide evidence to back-up a claim in the main text that&#8217;s entirely unsupportable from what&#8217;s been presented. So it can be seen as both excessively long and insufficiently detailed, which is quite an&nbsp;achievement.

      Why is modern civilisation so self-destructive and complicated? The answer from this alternative history is that a previously time of happiness and long lives was subverted by a change in the universal forces to induce the current malaise.<br><br>I did enjoy this book, but it does live up to its sub-title: <i>Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days</i>. It&#8217;s told in a very disjointed form using purported reports and other documents, much of the time from the diary of a young girl who doesn&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s going on, and so can&#8217;t really advance the plot very effectively. That makes it hard work, even though the writing and the overall premise are&nbsp;excellent.

A gloriously opinionated (in the best way) take on Lisp macro
programming. The author treats Lisp – one of the first languages
– as the ultimate, <i>final</i> language to which all others can (and
should) be translated, since they&#8217;re simply special cases of Lisp
forms. And he makes a surprisingly compelling&nbsp;case.
</p>

<p>
The material builds extensively on <a href="/2024/07/05/on-lisp/">On Lisp</a>, re-presenting the
idea of <i>anaphoric</i> macros (those that bind lexical variables for
use in their bodies) and extending them with <i>pandoric</i> macros
that allow introspection into an otherwise closed lexical
environment. A lot of these examples feel contrived as presented,
but the techniques are anything but: powerful ways to build&nbsp;abstractions.
</p>

<p>
The finale is the implementation of Forth in Lisp, and then a
reflection to allow Forth programs to define Lisp functions –
converting a (transparent) threaded-interpreted structure into an
(opaque) code block. It&#8217;s a slightly non-standard Forth, but it&#8217;s
true to the basics and exposes issues like the implementations of
interpretation, compilation, and tail recursion really well. It&#8217;s
only another step to explore Lisp <i>implemented</i> in Forth through
the medium of macro programming, which deserves a book&nbsp;itself.

One of the most famous advanced treatments of Lisp. Essentially
it&#8217;s a book in two parts. The first deals with the traditional
advanced topics of functional programming such as identifying
patterns that can be factored-out into higher-order functions and
re-used. But the second, better-known, part deals with macro
programming in extraordinary detail and with enormous creativity,
including developing macros for continuations and several embedded&nbsp;languages.

</p>

<p>
A four-part blog post series on debugging Lisp,&nbsp;covering:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Live recompilation of code from inside a debugging session,
together with re-executing changed code from within a running
stack&nbsp;trace</li>
<li>Inspecting objects and interacting with traces of function&nbsp;calls</li>
<li>Redefining classes, and how to ensure that existing instances
are upgraded to be compatible with the new&nbsp;definition</li>
<li>Restarts, the neglected part of the condition system that
controls how programs continue after encountering&nbsp;errors</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first two are essential, and show how <i>different</i> Lisp
programming is from using other languages. In fact it requires a
considerable mental shift to re-acquire the right reflexes for
dealing with errors and debugging in a fully interactive
environment: well, it did for me, anyway. We&#8217;re not used to
interactivity in large development environments. There is seldom
any need to close down a running Lisp session and start again, as
everything can usually be changed and adapted within a session.
This is very unlike the usual compile-edit-debug cycles we&#8217;ve
become accustomed&nbsp;to.
</p>

<p>
The third post – on redefining classes – shows how one can
upgrade a program that simply <i>has</i> to keep running, because its
live state upgrade can be programmed&nbsp;too.
</p>

<p>
The most significant part of the mental shift is to realise that
the debugger is written in Lisp itself, and makes use of restarts
and other features to provide the interface. This is a consequence
of the degree of exposure of the Lisp run-time structures into to
language itself, where they can be examined and manipulated using
the full power of the language – and then be re-started or
discarded as&nbsp;required.

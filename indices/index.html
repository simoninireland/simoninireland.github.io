<h2 id="orgb0dcbd6">Lisp macros <i>versus</i> Rust&nbsp;macros</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0dcbd6">
<p>
I was talking with one of my colleagues the other day about
programming languages, and we ended up comparing macros in Rust and&nbsp;Lisp.
</p>

<p>
Rust has a couple of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">couple of different kinds</a> of macros:
<b>declarative</b> macros that pattern-match on arguments to emit code; and
<b>procedural</b> macros that perform more general code-to-code
transformations. Lisp has only one kind that operates from code to&nbsp;code.
</p>

<p>
Both approaches are <i>far</i> more powerful than the macros in C and C++,
which are basically just string expanders. Indeed, one definition of
macroprogramming is that it&#8217;s writing code that returns code, and
there&#8217;s a reasonable argument that C&#8217;s &#8220;macros&#8221; are programs that
return <i>strings</i> and therefore aren&#8217;t macros at all. But that&#8217;s just
bring&nbsp;pedantic.
</p>

<p>
The Rust operations seem quite awkward, at least from a Lisp
perspective. They&#8217;re invoked in a way that&#8217;s syntactically different
to ordinary code, so it&#8217;s always possible to see in the source code
where procedural code generation is occurring. Perhaps that&#8217;s not an
entirely bad thing, as it makes it obvious when compile-time
computation occurs – although one might also argue that a true
language extension or <span class="caps">DSL</span> should be so seamless that you don&#8217;t <i>need</i>
to see&nbsp;it.
</p>

<p>
I think a more basic difference is in how Rust needs to handle
code-type arguments. A macro is a function from code to code, so it
needs to represent its code arguments in a way that the macros
(which is also code) can manipulate. Lisp&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a> makes this
trivial: code is a list, just like non-code, and can ba manipulated
as such. Rust doesn&#8217;t have this, so code needs to be passed to
macros as a token stream that&#8217;s been parsed from the program text.
That&#8217;s a reasonable solution to the problem, but it does mean that
to write macros you need to understand how Rust is tokenised. You
also get a token stream, not an abstract syntax tree (<span class="caps">AST</span>), which
means that manipulating complex code is more difficult: essentially
you need to re-create as much of the <span class="caps">AST</span> as you need and traverse it
within the macro body. There&#8217;s a standard library that does this for
Rust&#8217;s own syntax, which simplifies matters somewhat but still means
that writing macros exposes the programmer to the underlying
representations. Hopefully they won&#8217;t change, as that would break a
lot of&nbsp;macros.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, Lisp macros only require an understanding of Lisp
itself, not of its internals, and can operate on the entire detailed
structure of the code arguments. It&#8217;s a striking example of the
power of&nbsp;homoiconicity.
</p>

<p>
An approach closer to that of Rust is also available, in Common Lisp
anyway, in the form of <b>reader macros</b> that modify the Lisp reader to
allow access to the character stream as the source code is being
read. I think I&#8217;ve only ever encountered read macros for providing
new styles of literals, or variants of strings that benefit from
being treated slightly differently at read-time: they&#8217;re an unusual
use case, anyway, and Lisp makes the more usual case of macros
manipulating Lisp code a lot simpler, without exposing the
programmer to&nbsp;parsing.
</p>

<p>
I suspect the main difference between the two languages&#8217; approaches
is that macros are <b>additional</b> to Rust but <b>inherent</b> to Lisp. None of
the core of Rust uses macros: they&#8217;re for extensions. By contrast,
even common operations&nbsp;like <code>defun</code> in Lisp are actually macros that
expand to the simpler core operations. This perhaps explains the
Rust designers&#8217; decision to make macros syntactically&nbsp;distinct.

<p>
The uMoth&nbsp;generates <code>.wav</code> files, uncompressed waveforms of what it
records. These need to be processed to identify any bird calls
within&nbsp;them.
</p>

<p>
This function is integrated in BirdNET-Pi, which does recording and
classification, and provides a web <span class="caps">GUI</span>. With the uMoths we need to
provide classification as part of a data processing pipeline. We
can however make direct use of the classifier &#8220;brain&#8221; within
BirdNET-<span class="caps">PI</span>, which is unsurprisingly called <a href="https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer">BirdNET-Analyzer</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1ca5243" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1ca5243">Installation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1ca5243">
<p>
I&#8217;m working on a 16-core Intel Core i7@3.8GHz running Arch&nbsp;Linux.
</p>

<p>
First we clone the BirdNET-Analyzer repo. This takes a long time
as it includes the <span class="caps">ML</span> models, some of which are <span class="caps">40MB</span> or&nbsp;more.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    git clone https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer.git
    cd BirdNET-Analyzer
</pre></div>

<p>
The repo includes a Docker file that we can use to build the
analyser in a&nbsp;container.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    docker build .
</pre></div>

<p>
The container setup is quite basic and is probably intended for
testing rather than production, but it gives a usable system that
could then be embedded into something more usable. The core of the
system is&nbsp;the <code>analyze.py</code> script.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge6466b1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge6466b1">Analysing some data (<span class="caps">AKA</span> identifying some&nbsp;birds!)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge6466b1">
<p>
The container as defined looks into&nbsp;its <code>/example</code> directory for
waveforms and analyses them, generating text file for each sample.
The easiest way to get it to analyse captured data is to mount a
data directory of files onto this mount point (thereby shadowing
the example waveform&nbsp;provided).
</p>

<p>
There are various parameters that configure the classifier. I
copied the <a href="/2024/05/19/first-installation/">defaults I was using with BirdNET-Pi</a>, only accepting classifications
at or above 0.7&nbsp;confidence.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    docker run -v /var/run/media/sd80/DATA:/example birdnet-analyzer analyze.py --rtype=csv --min_conf=0.7 --sensitivity=1.25
</pre></div>

<p>
This crunches through all the files (982 of them from my first
run) and generates a <span class="caps">CSV</span> file for each. An example&nbsp;is:

<p>
Those are entirely credible identifications. The start- and
end-point offsets allow rough location within the recording.
(BirdNET segments the recordings into 3s chunks for&nbsp;analysis.)
</p>

<p>
This is clearly not as straightforward as BirdNET-Pi, nor as
immediately satisfying. But it does scale to analysing lots of
data (and could be made to do so even better, with a better
front-end to the container), which is important for any
large-scale&nbsp;deployment.

<p>
The MicroMoth (or uMoth) from <a href="personal/notebook/open_acoustic_devices-contact.html#ID-c0a38f8e-970a-499d-a30e-56ec235b6ea9">Open Acoustic Devices</a> is the same as
their better-known AudioMoth recorder but with a significantly
smaller footprint. It&#8217;s just a traditional recorder or data-logger,
with now on-board analysis and no wireless connectivity. I got hold
of some to use in a larger project we&#8217;re thinking about running, and
they&#8217;re not kidding about the &#8220;micro&#8221;&nbsp;part.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../attachments/4b/0ad2d7-5cb3-4b93-a0ec-4963e2868155/IMG_20240528_144150.jpg" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
The uMoth uses the same software as the AudioMoth, and therefore
the same configuration app available from the <a href="https://www.openacousticdevices.info/applications">apps page</a> – for
64-bit Linux in my case. It downloads as&nbsp;a <code>.appimage</code> file, which
is simply a self-contained archive. It needed to be marked as
executable, and then ran directly from a double-click. (The page
suggests that there may be some extra steps for some Linux
distros: there weren&#8217;t for&nbsp;Arch.)
</p>

<p>
I then followed the <a href="https://www.openacousticdevices.info/config-app-guide">configuration guide</a>. The time is set
automatically from the computer&#8217;s clock when you configure the&nbsp;device.
</p>

<p>
For testing I chose two recording periods, 0400–0800 and&nbsp;1400–1600.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../attachments/4b/0ad2d7-5cb3-4b93-a0ec-4963e2868155/config.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
As shown this will, with the default 48KHz sampling, generate
about <span class="caps">2GB</span> of data per day and use about 70mAh of energy. For my
tests I just hung the device out of the window on a <span class="caps">USB</span> tether for
power: it works fine drawing power from the <span class="caps">USB</span> rather than from
the battery&nbsp;connector.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../attachments/4b/0ad2d7-5cb3-4b93-a0ec-4963e2868155/IMG_20240608_141527.jpg" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
This turned out not to record anything, because the time is lost
if the power is disconnected, even though the configuration is
retained. (The manual does actually say this, with a suitably
close reading. It could be clearer.) There&#8217;s a smartphone app that
can reset the time once the device is in the field and powered-up,
though, by making an audio chime that encodes the current time and
location in a way the board can understand. Flashing the device
with the &#8220;Always require acoustic chime on switching to <span class="caps">CUSTOM</span>&#8221;
makes it wait after power is applied until its time is&nbsp;set.
</p>

<p>
The red <span class="caps">LED</span> flashes when the device is recording. The green <span class="caps">LED</span>
flashes when the device is waiting for a recording period to
start. The red <span class="caps">LED</span> stays lit while the time is&nbsp;unset.

This a really brief, yet really interesting, approach to
introducing Lisp to someone. Interesting because it covers all the
usual ground, but also has copious pointers to other material
slightly-beyond-introductory (&#8220;Where to go from here&#8221;). It also
links to material that&#8217;s essential to modern practice, such as
Lisp packages and systems, and the essential &#8220;standard libraries&#8221;
such as Alexandria, Bordeaux, <span class="caps">CL</span>-<span class="caps">PPCRE</span>, usocket, and the like: the
things that are needed in practice and which in other languages
would probably be built-in and included directly in an&nbsp;introduction.

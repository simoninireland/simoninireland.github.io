      The space race from the American perspective is well-known: this book presents the same race from the Soviet perspective.<br><br>The differences are profound, of course, mainly driven by the Soviet programme occurring in complete secrecy to duck the risks that failure would have on the programme&#8217;s image. The American programme by contrast was conducted in the open at least as far as the actual &#8220;shots&#8221; were concerned – and their public failures did indeed endanger their ability to continue, at least in part because neither public nor politicians understood the process of engineering or just how <i>hard</i> each shot was. The deep irony is that the Soviet successes appeared so sudden and dramatic they led directly to the deepening of the American programme and commitment or more money and effort than the Soviets seemed able to maintain to capitalise on their early lead.<br><br>There are plenty of revelations even for those with a detailed interest in space history. I remember hearing all through the 1970s that the Soviet spacecraft landed on land, but it turns out that in many cases the cosmonauts were bailing-out and parachuting to earth instead, with this being intensively covered-up even to the extent of falsifying reports to the international organisation responsible for certifying &#8220;firsts&#8221; in space.<br><br>While the achievements of both programmes were profound, they were perhaps doomed in the long term by a lack of vision for what they were actually <i>for</i>. The benefits of space technology are now obvious; those of exploration perhaps less so, although it doesn&#8217;t (in my opinion) require much suspension of disbelief to feel that science-driven activities lead almost inevitably to enormously valuable spin-offs. The fact that we can&#8217;t quantify these <i>a priori</i> shouldn&#8217;t (in my opinion, again) stop us keeping the faith in the value of experiments that advance our science <i>and</i> engineering in ways that wouldn&#8217;t otherwise&nbsp;happen.

      A very technical examination of the world&#8217;s first numerical weather &#8220;prediction&#8221; – although in fact it was really a &#8220;postdiction&#8221;, taking detailed data and using it to compute a scenario that could be compared against a known ground truth. It was an incredible achievement anyway, performing manually and at low resolution the calculations now routinely performed by computers.<br><br>Richardson was the person who saw that this would be possible, realising that the physics and mathematics could be solved even though the computational capabilities didn&#8217;t exist. In this he foresaw the emergence of the modern power of data, where the existence of more and better data transforms both the way we do science and the sciene that we do. It&#8217;s something that should put him alongside Turing and Von Neumann as visionaries of what computation could&nbsp;achieve.

Could social media posts be actively damaging to our mental health?
– literally, not just figuratively? That&#8217;s the premise of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/09/techscape-deepfakes-cognitohazards-science-fiction">a
TechScape article in The Guardian</a>, that draws on both science
fiction and psychological&nbsp;research.
</p>

<p>
In Neal Stephenson&#8217;s &#8220;Snow crash&#8221; there is a plot device of an image
in a metaverse that, when viewed, crashes the viewer&#8217;s brain. We
haven&#8217;t seen this in social media (yet), but there&#8217;s an increasing
concern about deepfake images and other forms of misinformation.
Research suggests that such images are damaging <i>even if viewers
know that they&#8217;re fakes</i>, which suggests that techniques like
content-labelling images as <span class="caps">AI</span>-generated are insufficient to remove
their harm. Other examples include massively engaging artificial
images such as the &#8220;pong wars&#8221; animation of two simultaneous
&#8220;Breakout&#8221; games going on between two algorithms: something that
shouldn&#8217;t be as engaging as it is (as I can attest to&nbsp;myself).
</p>

<p>
Social media attention grabbing at an industrial scale might
therefore constitute a <i>cognitohazard</i>, a way of hacking people&#8217;s
brains simply by being&nbsp;viewed.

      The history of what is still as I write this an ongoing scandal: perhaps the greatest miscarriage of justice in <span class="caps">UK</span> history, when the Post Office turned on and prosecuted its own operators for fraud on the basis of flawed evidence from its Horizon <span class="caps">IT</span> system.<br><br>The scandal came from a series of interlocking arrangements. The Post Office could mount prosecutions in its own right (something that its management now claims to have been unaware of), with its own investigators able to interview under caution but seemingly not required to record interviews or allow legal representation. The contracts under which postmasters operated were mis-represented to turn any discrepancies into the postmasters&#8217; fault, while simultaneously denying them the data they&#8217;d need to investigate themselves unless they were exceptionally careful and persistent – and the few who <i>were</i> were prosecuted and driven out anyway. <br><br>As a computer scientist I have to say that the most ridiculous part of the story is the presumption in law that a computer system works properly absent explicit to the contrary, that – when coupled with an asymmetry of who can access to software and its logs – makes it impossible to fight against computer-generated evidence. No system of this size <i>ever</i> works flawlessly, and a careful designer would add features on that assumption, such as paper-trails or detailed logs that can then be forensically analysed. Equally, no such system would ever be constructed without remote access to terminal endpoints to allow problems to be remotely fixed, and again a careful designer would ensure that such interventions were logged so as to be auditable. This is so self-evident that I find it hard to believe that Horizon <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> designed that way, which makes the repeated denials even more suspicious.<br><br>But there&#8217;s a social commentary here too. The justice system, juries, and the communities of the prosecuted postmasters were almost eager to believe their guilt. Part of that was the lack of proper media scrutiny to bring the extent of prosecutions into the public eye, and part due to obfuscation by the Post Office itself – but it surely there should be systemic oversight of such things, given the massive consequences. And surely communities should have been less ready to believe accusations made against their own members that went against the evidence of their own&nbsp;eyes.

Mark Watson.  <i><a href="https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp">Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer’s Secret
Weapon</a></i>. Leanpub.&nbsp;2023.
</p>

<p>
While pitched as a way of sharing the author&#8217;s enthusiasm for Lisp
(which really shines through), this book is really a deep
demonstration in using Lisp in modern applications – from web
APIs and the semantic web to deep learning, large language models,
and&nbsp;chatbots.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, like many other Lisp books, it&#8217;s really two books in
one. The first chapters are introductory – and to be perfectly
honest could be dispensed with, as they&#8217;re inadequate as a proper
introduction and there are far better introductions out there. The
later chapters focus on applications, and provide the real value.
One could criticise them as often tying-together tools in other
languages, with the Lisp code basically being glue; but that&#8217;s a
very effective way of leveraging all the code and services out
there, and is an important technique for Lisp programmers&nbsp;too.

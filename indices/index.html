<p>
Nils Holm.  <i>Lisp from Nothing</i>. Lulu Press.&nbsp;2025.
</p>

<p>
This is a fascinating book that&#8217;s very old-school – and I mean
that in the best possible way. It does exactly what it says:
develops a Lisp interpreter (and then a compiler) from first
principles, bootstrapped on top of an existing Lisp or Scheme
against a runtime written in C, with all code&nbsp;provided.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s more than this, though. There&#8217;s a thorough discussion of the
differences between dynamic and lexical variable scope (and the
implications for both programming and implementation). There&#8217;s a
digression into pure lambda calculus and the complexities that <i>it</i>
introduces. There&#8217;s a basic mark/sweep garbage collector. There&#8217;s
a brief history of Lisp and Lisp machines. And there&#8217;s a
performance evaluation that digs into where the costs lie within
the&nbsp;system.
</p>

<p>
Overall this is a book that every implementor should read, if only
to see some other parts of the possible design space for Lisp
tooling. Many applications will want to occupy a different point
in that space, for example providing a richer compiler, or a
richer runtime. But there&#8217;s a lot to learn from the simplicity of
the choices made&nbsp;here.

      A fascinating history of bookbinding and printing. You may have to be fanatical about your books and book technology to fully enjoy it – but I certainly did.<br><br>There are plenty of vignettes and personalities on offer, alongside a deep understanding of the history that accepts the boundaries of what&#8217;s knowable. The value we place on certain books shifts with time, with Shakespeare&#8217;s First Folio simply being one amongst many when it is first printed. And the notion of canonical texts can be fluid, with several often entirely different editions of <i>Hamlet</i> to choose from, as well as an active sub-culture of after-market book repurposing ending in modern zines and found-media works.<br><br>The most fascinating aspect for me was the way that some books have been lost and are known only through commentaries on them that (perversely) survived – and some are known through having been cut-up and re-used as parts of the bindings of other books, for example to make covers essentially from <i>papier mâché</i>, from which they have been recovered during re-binding.<br><br>The style can be a bit annoying in places, a mispaced need for levity that comes across as far too heavy-handed and trite. But overall this is a great read, equally full of information and&nbsp;entertainment.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      I&#8217;m hard-put to classify this book. On the one hand it&#8217;s an engaging and valiant attempt to illustrate the crafts that would need to be retained (or rediscovered) after a civilisational collapse – or at least after <i>one kind of</i> collapse such as a pandemic that leaves the infrastructure intact by decaying rather than pulverised. Dartnell seems to think a more fierce collapse would be unsurvivable, and so focuses on the more positive possibility.<br><br>He traverses a lot of technologies, including for agriculture, building, transportation, clothing, chemistry, and communications. He (correctly in my view) identifies the scientific method itself as the most valuable technology to retain, and explores some of the ways in which modern society is contingent on specific historical accidents that a re-booting society need not copy.<br><br>But it&#8217;s also frustrating. As a scientist and engineer I wanted more detail: perhaps there&#8217;s a need for another, &#8220;how to&#8221; manual alongside this book. And Dartnell seems to have a very cavalier attitude towards safety, mentioning and understating the dangers of (for example) lye once and then making use of it extensively, which is a recipe for disaster on the part of any practitioners. And the book is a little too broad, rather than focusing on the technologies of immediate relevance in the aftermath of disaster: should we really be thinking about building vacuum-tube electronics when even basic agriculture is such a challenge?<br><br>Despite the positivity on display, reading this confirmed my thinking that a recovery after a disaster would be protracted, with no way to avoid a return to feudalism and warring bands. In that sense technology would be the least of the survivors&#8217;&nbsp;worries.

Proceedings of the 1984 <span class="caps">ACM</span> Symposium on Lisp and Functional
Programming</i>, pp.299–310.&nbsp;1984.
</p>

<p>
A study of Lisp&#8217;s evolution from first proposal to practical&nbsp;implementation.
</p>

<p>
It begins with McCarthy&#8217;s proposal (co-authored with Marvin
Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, and dated 31
August 1955) for a summer research project at Dartmouth College to
&#8220;study the relationship of language to&nbsp;intelligence&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
In a later (handwritten!) note McCarthy homed-in on the core
challenges in this programme: the lack of a clear way to describe
<i>procedures</i> to each other (what <a href="https://simondobson.org/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/">Abelson and Sussman</a> later refer to
as <i>procedural epistemology</i>), and the tight binding of programming
systems at that time to specific machines, and hence their need to
bow to engineering (rather than semantic) considerations. The
language that became Lisp sought primarily to overcome these two&nbsp;challenges.
</p>

<p>
The journey proceeded by taking the list data structures developed
by Allen Newell and Herb Simon as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist">Logic Theorist</a> and
embedding them into <span class="caps">FORTRAN</span> (for which there was already a working
compiler) – which also incidentally muddied the conceptual waters
by trying to express list and list-functional concepts in a
language built around numbers that barely allowed functions to be
defined by the user at all. Indeed, McCarthy and others had
long-running problems accepting that the list-processing functions
<i>were</i> functions, given that their result does not depend solely on
their arguments when viewed at the lowest level. This shows how
pernicious a low-level implementation can be. The final resulting
language, the <span class="caps">FORTRAN</span> List Processing Language (<span class="caps">FLPL</span>), shared many
programming approaches function names with what became&nbsp;Lisp.
</p>

<p>
McCarthy went on to champion the functional approach, including
the invention of conditional expressions (alongside or replacing
conditional statements) and the power of the different kinds of
function composition and higher-order functions. It&#8217;s important to
remember that McCarthy&#8217;s driving interest remained in <span class="caps">AI</span>, not
programming languages <i>per se</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Already in 1956 it was clear that one had to work with symbolic
expressions to reach the goal of artificial&nbsp;intelligence.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Which is a fascinating piece of history in itself, as a large
branch of modern <span class="caps">AI</span> concerning machine learning and large language
models has explicit rejects this view in favour of sub-symbolic
<span class="caps">AI</span>. Which approach is &#8220;correct&#8221; in whatever sense remains to be&nbsp;seen.
</p>

<p>
But it remains McCarthy&#8217;s contributions to programming languages
that stand out. As well as conditional expressions he can be
credited with garbage collection, meta-circular interpretation,
and clarifying the relationship between programming and&nbsp;proof:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We should mention here that McCarthy at the same time conceived the
idea of logic-oriented programming, that is, the idea of using logical
formulae to express goals that a program should try to establish and
of using the prover as programming language&nbsp;interpreter.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Although it&#8217;s important to recognise that Newell and Simon&#8217;s
work, on logic as an application rather than as a general
programming language, pre-dates&nbsp;McCarthy&#8217;s.)

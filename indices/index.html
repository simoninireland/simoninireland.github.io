	Nicole Perlroth&nbsp;(2021)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A hugely detailed and deeply researched history of the market for &#8220;zero-day: exploits, the faults and technologies underlying computer viruses and ransomware. It&#8217;s a hugely complicated and technical field which Perlroth does an amazing job of making accessible to a non-technical audience. (I should probably say here that I teach computer security.)<br><br>Most of the book is a real page-turner, deeply embedded with the government agencies, companies, and hackers who compose the zero-day market. It&#8217;s scathing of the <span class="caps">US</span>&#8217; trying to play both sides of the street, developing and buying zero-days in order to collect intelligence while weakening the security of ordinary users in the process by not informing the software developers of the problems they&#8217;ve found. They clearly knew this was dangerous, and even developed a doctrine for us: &#8220;<span class="caps">NOBUS</span>&#8221;, bugs that &#8220;no-one but us&#8221; would be smart enough to find or develop. This idea goes wrong spectacularly, as other nations realise how cheaply they too can have cyberweapons programmes: ironically they&#8217;re encouraged by the deployment of the Stuxnet virus to damage the Iranian nuclear programme. The leaks of the <span class="caps">NSA</span>&#8217;s zero-day stockpile by the Shadow Brokers – an event that&#8217;s somewhat under-explored – and their later use in hacks against <span class="caps">US</span> elections, are payback for hubris.<br><br>Perlroth is scathing of the Trump presidency&#8217;s neglect of cybersecurity and unwillingness to sanction Russia for known attacks – in part because it might cast doubt on Trump&#8217;s legitimacy as an elected president, but also seemingly from willful blindness and a mistrust of the professionals (including the military) tasked with protecting <span class="caps">US</span> networks. She was writing during the pandemic and before Trump conceded the 2020 election (to the extent that he ever did), and so if anything she understated the impacts of disinformation spreading.<br><br>The conclusions are a little breathless, but well-intentioned and technically appropriate, if a little <span class="caps">US</span>-centric – and in fairness the <span class="caps">US</span> has at least attempted to set up a more transparent approach to managing cyberweapons, even though the approach is drastically compromised by the desire to keep intelligence-gathering capabilities. Cybersecurity is an area where offence and defence are closely intertwined, and there&#8217;s a strong argument that the costs to society of the former mandate a focus on the latter. We need to accept that many cyberweapons that are used (or leaked) can be reverse-engineered and re-used against their original developers with little real up-front financial investment.<br><br>There&#8217;s some editing. including a repeated mis-use of &#8220;affect&#8221; rather than &#8220;effect&#8221;, and a really disastrous throw-away reference to the book <i>Dune</i>, the description of which is almost entirely wrong: surely an editor should have picked that&nbsp;up?

	Ha-Joon Chang&nbsp;(2022)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A book that combines food with economics? Not really.<br><br>I&#8217;m torn by this book. I enjoyed the food parts, especially the author&#8217;s anecdotes about his move to the <span class="caps">UK</span> from Korea, and how he&#8217;s observed the <span class="caps">UK</span>&#8217;s food scene change from incredibly insular and conservative to amazingly open and dynamic over the course of a couple of decades. It&#8217;s a change I also lived through and remember well.<br><br>I also enjoyed the economics. Chang is an eclectic collector of economic theories – all the more surprising because he&#8217;s an academic. He has an appropriate degree of scepticism for ideology and single explanation of complex questions, which is refreshing. He skewers some of the common myths, such as the &#8220;explanation&#8221; that poor countreis stay poor because their people don&#8217;t work hard enough, ingoring the massive structural factors in play. He&#8217;s equally scathing about the other &#8220;explanation&#8221; about the free-trade roots of the successes of the <span class="caps">US</span> and <span class="caps">UK</span> economies, given that they were actually massively protectionist during their main periods of growth. And he makes several policy suggestions for modern economies.<br><br>But&#8230;. as a book, I don&#8217;t think it works at all. The conceit of explaining economics through food remains just that: a conceit that&#8217;s not really threaded through the narrative in a meaningful way. The links are often just too tenuous. To give one example, a chapter that leads with anchovies ends up talking about natural-resource extraction economics using the example of bird guano – well, birds eat anchovies, so&#8230; Most of the chapters are basically diviided between food and economics with an often desperate attempt to tie them together. The economics is accessible, and a writer who can do that probably doesn&#8217;t need a gimmick to structure his&nbsp;work.

<p>
Today I learned that <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/10/20/mary-somerville/">the first person ever to be called a
&#8220;scientist&#8221;</a> was the Scottish … erm, scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville">Mary Sommerville</a>
(1780–1872), who made discoveries across several fields of
mathematics, physics, and astronomy, and was one of the first two
women admitted to membership of the Royal Astronomical&nbsp;Society.
</p>

<p>
It was the fact that she was both a woman and a polymath that led to
the need for a new word. She clearly wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;man of science&#8221;, as
was the common description; nor did she fall into the accepted
classes such as geologist or chemist, since she contributed to all
these fields and more. So <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whewell">William Whewell</a>, the Master of Trinity
College, Cambridge, and the person who had introduced one of
Sommerville&#8217;s books to the university&#8217;s maths curriculum, decided to
unify all these specific classes into the new general category of
<i>scientist</i>. (He also introduced the terms <i>physicist</i> and
<i>linguistics</i>.)

<p>
Today I learned that the first .com internet domain registered on
the internet was <a href="https://symbolics.com">https://symbolics.com</a> and belonged to Symbolics, a
company that made Lisp&nbsp;machines.
</p>

<p>
It doesn&#8217;t relate to Lisp any more, of course. It&#8217;s been sold to
someone who &#8220;helps entrepreneurs and investors acquire high-end
domain names&#8221;, which seems about as meta as things can get: the
first-ever .com domain name now points a company focused on
acquiring domain&nbsp;names.
</p>

<p>
Symbolics itself has a storied history, spinning-out from the <span class="caps">MIT</span> <span class="caps">AI</span>
lab to sell hardware dedicated to running Lisp: one of <i>two</i> such
start-ups actually. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics">Wikipedia page</a> is a good place to&nbsp;start.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, the rest of the top-ten first .com domains can be
found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/dec/22/internet-domains">here</a>.

<h2 id="org86b476d">Making small changes to lots of&nbsp;files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org86b476d">
<p>
I recently had to make tiny changes to a large number of files
spread nested through a directory structure. This turns out to be a
lot easier than I expected with&nbsp;Emacs.
</p>

<p>
My use case was actually this blog. It&#8217;s been on the go for a while
in several different formats, and over the years I&#8217;ve used tags to
drive different presentations – for example articles tagged &#8216;news&#8217;
ended up on the front page. I no longer do this, which meant a lot
of redundant tags to be got rid of, mainly in&nbsp;Nikola&#8217;s <code>.meta</code>
metadata files but also embedded&nbsp;into <code>.md</code> markdown&nbsp;and <code>.rst</code>
restructured&nbsp;text..
</p>

<p>
My plan was to use&nbsp;Emacs&#8217; <code>rgrep</code> command to recursively traverse
the directory structure of posts to find the tags I wanted to
remove. This would give me&nbsp;a <code>grep</code>-mode buffer that hyperlinks to
the files (and lines) needing changing, which I could then click
through to get to where each change needed to be made.
Straightforward, but time-consuming and error-prone when there were
about 150 files to be changed. Clearly a problem in need of a better&nbsp;solution.
</p>

<p>
I then discovered the <a href="https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep/raw/master/wgrep.el"><code>wgrep</code></a>&nbsp;(&#8220;writable <code>grep</code><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>) package. This
makes&nbsp;the <code>grep</code>-mode buffer editable, with changes being
written-back to the underlying files. <i>Exactly</i> what I&nbsp;needed.
</p>

<p>
Once I&#8217;d&nbsp;installed <code>wgrep</code>, the workflow is ridiculously&nbsp;easy:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Using <code>rgrep</code> gets&nbsp;a <code>grep</code>-mode&nbsp;buffer</li>
<li>
<code>C-c C-p</code> makes the buffer&nbsp;editable</li>
<li>Changing the lines. In my case I could&nbsp;use <code>string-replace</code> to
remove the tags I wanted rid of. More complicated cases might&nbsp;need <code>regexp-replace</code> or even manual&nbsp;editing</li>
<li>
<code>C-x C-s</code> writes the changes back&nbsp;out</li>
</ol>
<p>
(There are several other keybindings&nbsp;that <code>wgrep</code> makes
available,&nbsp;notably <code>C-c C-k</code> to discard all&nbsp;changes.)
</p>

<p>
That&#8217;s it! A job that I expected to take an hour took about 3&nbsp;minutes.

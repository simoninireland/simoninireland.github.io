The BirdNET-Pi system aims to provide out-of-the-box bird
identification. It&#8217;s slightly more awkward than that, but still
pretty straightforward to get up and&nbsp;running.
</p>

<p>
My first hardware plan was to use a Raspberry Pi Zero as the
compute host with a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wm8960-audio-hat.htm">Waveshare <span class="caps">WM8960</span> <span class="caps">HAT</span></a> for the sound capture. It
turns out that BirdNET needs a 64-bit platform – why I&#8217;m not sure
– and the Pi Zero only runs 32-bit Linux. I therefore moved to a
Raspberry Pi B that I had lying around, and put a 64-bit &#8220;lite&#8221;
install on it to run&nbsp;headless.
</p>

<p>
I then basically just followed the <a href="https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Installation-Guide">installation guide</a>. There was an
issue with the installation script when cloning the GitHub repo: I
suspect this was because of limited memory on the Pi. I downloaded
manually, and manually ran the rest of the install script, which did
a <i>lot</i> of setup of services and a <span class="caps">PHP</span> web&nbsp;server.
</p>

<p>
I compiled the <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/WM8960_Audio_HAT">drivers</a> for the <span class="caps">HAT</span>, which worked fine. The new
sound card is recognised but is not the system&nbsp;default.
</p>

<p>
The installed components seem to&nbsp;include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<code>icecast2</code>, a streaming server, used to replay&nbsp;recordings</li>
<li>
<code>caddy</code> web&nbsp;server</li>
<li><span class="caps">PHP</span> for serving the web&nbsp;pages</li>
<li>
<code>arecord</code> to actually record&nbsp;audio</li>
<li>
<code>ffmpeg</code> to extract&nbsp;waveforms</li>
<li><code>sqlite for the database</code></li>
<li>the actual machine learning model used for&nbsp;recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>
The recognition models are built with TensorFlow. This is a great
example of how the standard Linux tools and services can be combined
to get a scientific-grade sensor platform. (Caddy doesn&#8217;t seem to be
running over <span class="caps">TLS</span> by default, which would be an issue outside a&nbsp;firewall.)
</p>

<p>
Since the sound card isn&#8217;t the default, the easiest way to get the
system listening to the right mics is to change the device in the
&#8220;advanced settings&#8221; panel: in my case I changed from &#8220;default&#8221; to
&#8220;hw:2,0&#8221;, reflecting the output&nbsp;of <code>arecord -l</code> that shows the sound
card&nbsp;devices.
</p>

<p>
I then deployed the Pi out of the kitchen&nbsp;window.
</p>

<p>

<p>
To start with it wasn&#8217;t hearing anything, which I think may be
because of the waterfall in the courtyard: turning this off made
things much more&nbsp;effective:

<p>
That&#8217;s an appropriate set of birds being seen – and we hardly ever
<i>see</i> magpies, but know they&#8217;re around. There&#8217;s actually quite a lot
of background noise even in such a quiet village, but the bird
calls do stand&nbsp;out.
</p>

<p>
I can&#8217;t see any reason for the manual installation on bare metal:
as far as I can see everything could be containerised, which would
make deployment and management a <i>lot</i>&nbsp;easier.

<p>
Downloads&nbsp;of <code>epydemic</code>, my <a href="/development/projects/epydemic/">library</a> for epidemic (and other) process
simulation on networks (and hopefully other combinatorial structures
soon…) recently passed&nbsp;100,000.
</p>

<p>
That number comes from the project&#8217;s <a href="https://www.pepy.tech/projects/epydemic">PePy page</a>, which tracks
downloads from the main <a href="https://pypi.org/project/epydemic/">PyPi page</a> as used&nbsp;by <code>pip</code>. I can&#8217;t say
whether or not that number is accurate. Quite honestly it&#8217;s at least
98,000 more than I ever expected, but 100,000 feels like something
of a milestone to be pleased&nbsp;about.
</p>

<p>
<code>epydemic</code> came about because of a lack of standard tooling for doing
epidemic simulation. This involves a lot of stochastic simulation,
which is quite tricky code to write and to make efficient. Testing
the system actually involved us thinking more deeply about the
effectiveness of unit testing for stochastic code, which then led to
a <a href="/softcopy/stochastic-testing-21.pdf">presentation at <span class="caps">UK</span> Systems in 2021</a> explaining the problems we&#8217;d&nbsp;had.

Today I learned about a program that generates the sounds that help
people navigate as they exit long tunnels when an emergency such as
a fire has destroyed the&nbsp;visibility.

<p>
<a href="https://blog.funcall.org//lisp%20psychoacoustics/2024/05/01/worlds-loudest-lisp-program/">The World&#8217;s Loudest Lisp Program to the&nbsp;Rescue</a>

<p>
This describes the challenges of building a software system that has
to work unmonitored once deployed, for years, as well as
withstanding a fairly rugged environment where, for example, the
installedc hardware will be periodically sprayed with a
high-pressure hose as the walls get cleaned. Overall the system is
soft real-time, but has to cope with component failure, network
partitions, consensus, and all the usual distributed systems
challenges, while be guaranteed to work when&nbsp;needed.
</p>

<p>
The developers built the system in Common Lisp, which wouldn&#8217;t be
the normal go-to choice for an embedded system. But their argument
was that they could better handle complex and changing requirements
by retaining a high level of abstraction, and that development was
overall far faster than using C. Modern Common Lisp compilers are so
efficient that there&#8217;s no significant performance hit at deployment.
They made use of complicated components like planners (for which
Lisp is an ideal choice), and built a set of macros to wrap-up the
handling of industrial control and robust&nbsp;communications.

<p>
It&#8217;s a great&nbsp;read.

      The space race from the American perspective is well-known: this book presents the same race from the Soviet perspective.<br><br>The differences are profound, of course, mainly driven by the Soviet programme occurring in complete secrecy to duck the risks that failure would have on the programme&#8217;s image. The American programme by contrast was conducted in the open at least as far as the actual &#8220;shots&#8221; were concerned – and their public failures did indeed endanger their ability to continue, at least in part because neither public nor politicians understood the process of engineering or just how <i>hard</i> each shot was. The deep irony is that the Soviet successes appeared so sudden and dramatic they led directly to the deepening of the American programme and commitment or more money and effort than the Soviets seemed able to maintain to capitalise on their early lead.<br><br>There are plenty of revelations even for those with a detailed interest in space history. I remember hearing all through the 1970s that the Soviet spacecraft landed on land, but it turns out that in many cases the cosmonauts were bailing-out and parachuting to earth instead, with this being intensively covered-up even to the extent of falsifying reports to the international organisation responsible for certifying &#8220;firsts&#8221; in space.<br><br>While the achievements of both programmes were profound, they were perhaps doomed in the long term by a lack of vision for what they were actually <i>for</i>. The benefits of space technology are now obvious; those of exploration perhaps less so, although it doesn&#8217;t (in my opinion) require much suspension of disbelief to feel that science-driven activities lead almost inevitably to enormously valuable spin-offs. The fact that we can&#8217;t quantify these <i>a priori</i> shouldn&#8217;t (in my opinion, again) stop us keeping the faith in the value of experiments that advance our science <i>and</i> engineering in ways that wouldn&#8217;t otherwise&nbsp;happen.

    <p>
      A very technical examination of the world&#8217;s first numerical weather &#8220;prediction&#8221; – although in fact it was really a &#8220;postdiction&#8221;, taking detailed data and using it to compute a scenario that could be compared against a known ground truth. It was an incredible achievement anyway, performing manually and at low resolution the calculations now routinely performed by computers.<br><br>Richardson was the person who saw that this would be possible, realising that the physics and mathematics could be solved even though the computational capabilities didn&#8217;t exist. In this he foresaw the emergence of the modern power of data, where the existence of more and better data transforms both the way we do science and the sciene that we do. It&#8217;s something that should put him alongside Turing and Von Neumann as visionaries of what computation could&nbsp;achieve.

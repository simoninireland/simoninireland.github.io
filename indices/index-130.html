      Definitely a book in the recognisible style of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6088007.Neuromancer__Sprawl___1_" title="Neuromancer (Sprawl, #1) by William Gibson" rel="nofollow noopener">Neuromancer</a>, based on a complicated premise of multiple worlds and semi-shared histories. It&#8217;s possible for the inhabitants of one world (which may or may not be the &#8220;original&#8221;) to visit the parallel versions at different points in their histories, and <i>vice versa</i>, but not in such a way as to affect their own history: a neat way to avoid paradoxes.<br><br>I came to this book after watching the <span class="caps">TV</span> adaptation – which I have to say I think is better, although it strips-away some of the philosophical explanations in pursuit of a more rapid&nbsp;plot.

	Philip Roth&nbsp;(2004)

    <p>
      A carefully-constructed counterfactual of a fictional Lindbergh presidency and of America&#8217;s descent into fascism – before being saved from itself by the entreaties of a revered and bereaved widow. It&#8217;s clever and evocatively written from the perspective of a 9-year-old surrogate of Roth himself, and so convincing that the author feels the need to include a summary of the real historical figures he mentions as an appendix.<br><br>Reading this book in 2023 brings out some echoes that perhaps wouldn&#8217;t have been apparent on an earlier reading. There&#8217;s a lot of consideration of fake news, of misinformation and questionable government initiatives, and even of a &#8220;Big Lie&#8221; that populists and fabulists can lock onto. And it&#8217;s shocking that some the anti-Semitism that existed before and during the war still exists today, in an increasingly-less-camouflaged&nbsp;form.

	James Gleick&nbsp;(2011)
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A popular history of information, and of information theory and computing in particular.<br><br>Like Gleick&#8217;s other books, this book walks the fine line between too much science and too little depth. It avoids the maths entirely without ever abandoning the core insights that the maths provides. That&#8217;s something many scientists long to achieve, but seldom do: focusing on the concepts and treating the maths as a machine that&#8217;s only valuable once the concepts have been assimilated. Richard Feynman would have approved.<br><br>This book is strongest on Shannon and Babbage, two of the geniuses (along with Turing, von Neumann, and a few others) of the information age as it emerged over the course of a century from mathematics and engineering. The excursion into physicists&#8217; treatment of information is less convincing (at least from my computer scientist&#8217;s perspective), not least because of the inevitable confusions thrown up by quantum&nbsp;information.

This a really brief, yet really interesting, approach to
introducing Lisp to someone. Interesting because it covers all the
usual ground, but also has copious pointers to other material
slightly-beyond-introductory (&#8220;Where to go from here&#8221;). It also
links to material that&#8217;s essential to modern practice, such as
Lisp packages and systems, and the essential &#8220;standard libraries&#8221;
such as Alexandria, Bordeaux, <span class="caps">CL</span>-<span class="caps">PPCRE</span>, usocket, and the like: the
things that are needed in practice and which in other languages
would probably be built-in and included directly in an&nbsp;introduction.

      A short dispatch from another world. It&#8217;s hard to recognise the academia portrayed by Hardy, and I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a bad thing. One has to admire its purity, though: a principled neglect of everything outside a particular field of study, and the deeply interwoven social life that goes with it. It sounds at once attractive and claustrophobic, inspiring and shallow.<br><br>Hardy is a perfect narrator and exemplar, being so diffident about his own accomplishments as to characterise them as having worked with one excellent mathematician (Littlewood) and discovered another (Ramanujan). He was a lot more than that within the small world of number theory in which he worked, including being a foundational contributor to computational complexity theory (although not in the exact definition currently used).<br><br>Reading this book sometimes feels like an intellectual making a trip to the world of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58045504.Brideshead_Revisited_The_Sacred_and_Profane_Memories_of_Captain_Charles_Ryder" title="Brideshead Revisited The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder by Evelyn Waugh" rel="nofollow noopener">Brideshead Revisited</a>, and that may be the right way to think of academia in the inter-war years: tied-up in upper-class privilege, class-consciousness, and&nbsp;repression.

<h2 id="orgbcc6fc2">First installation of&nbsp;BirdNET-Pi</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbcc6fc2">
<p>
The BirdNET-Pi system aims to provide out-of-the-box bird
identification. It&#8217;s slightly more awkward than that, but still
pretty straightforward to get up and&nbsp;running.
</p>

<p>
My first hardware plan was to use a Raspberry Pi Zero as the
compute host with a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wm8960-audio-hat.htm">Waveshare <span class="caps">WM8960</span> <span class="caps">HAT</span></a> for the sound capture. It
turns out that BirdNET needs a 64-bit platform – why I&#8217;m not sure
– and the Pi Zero only runs 32-bit Linux. I therefore moved to a
Raspberry Pi B that I had lying around, and put a 64-bit &#8220;lite&#8221;
install on it to run&nbsp;headless.
</p>

<p>
I then basically just followed the <a href="https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Installation-Guide">installation guide</a>. There was an
issue with the installation script when cloning the GitHub repo: I
suspect this was because of limited memory on the Pi. I downloaded
manually, and manually ran the rest of the install script, which did
a <i>lot</i> of setup of services and a <span class="caps">PHP</span> web&nbsp;server.
</p>

<p>
I compiled the <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/WM8960_Audio_HAT">drivers</a> for the <span class="caps">HAT</span>, which worked fine. The new
sound card is recognised but is not the system&nbsp;default.
</p>

<p>
The installed components seem to&nbsp;include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<code>icecast2</code>, a streaming server, used to replay&nbsp;recordings</li>
<li>
<code>caddy</code> web&nbsp;server</li>
<li><span class="caps">PHP</span> for serving the web&nbsp;pages</li>
<li>
<code>arecord</code> to actually record&nbsp;audio</li>
<li>
<code>ffmpeg</code> to extract&nbsp;waveforms</li>
<li><code>sqlite for the database</code></li>
<li>the actual machine learning model used for&nbsp;recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>
The recognition models are built with TensorFlow. This is a great
example of how the standard Linux tools and services can be combined
to get a scientific-grade sensor platform. (Caddy doesn&#8217;t seem to be
running over <span class="caps">TLS</span> by default, which would be an issue outside a&nbsp;firewall.)
</p>

<p>
Since the sound card isn&#8217;t the default, the easiest way to get the
system listening to the right mics is to change the device in the
&#8220;advanced settings&#8221; panel: in my case I changed from &#8220;default&#8221; to
&#8220;hw:2,0&#8221;, reflecting the output&nbsp;of <code>arecord -l</code> that shows the sound
card&nbsp;devices.
</p>

<p>
I then deployed the Pi out of the kitchen&nbsp;window.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../attachments/18/408cf7-5f1f-4b07-81ef-e8f94d1c38d3/screenshot.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
To start with it wasn&#8217;t hearing anything, which I think may be
because of the waterfall in the courtyard: turning this off made
things much more&nbsp;effective:
</p>

<p>

<p>
That&#8217;s an appropriate set of birds being seen – and we hardly ever
<i>see</i> magpies, but know they&#8217;re around. There&#8217;s actually quite a lot
of background noise even in such a quiet village, but the bird
calls do stand&nbsp;out.
</p>

<p>
I can&#8217;t see any reason for the manual installation on bare metal:
as far as I can see everything could be containerised, which would
make deployment and management a <i>lot</i>&nbsp;easier.

      A shocking tale of aggression and duplicity, where a country whose only fault is to be too weak to resist incursions by another is attacked and undermined by a third country still claiming the moral high ground.<br><br>Alost every character comes out badly from this story – but especially Henry Kissinger, whose willingness to sacrifice foreign lives while protecting his own reputation and influence are quite breathtaking. It&#8217;s troubling that Nixon&#8217;s fall was for reasons <i>other</i> than his orders to bomb Cambodia and his willingness to lie to Congress (whom he was constitution-bound to consult and inform). The fact that the Cambodian leadership of Lon Nol and Sihanouk were also corrupt and self-serving offers no excuse. The <span class="caps">US</span> Joint Chiefs stood behind him because it suited them to extend the Vietnam War rather than end it, even after the point that they knew it was un-winnable and were extracting their own ground forces. Together these people all opened the door for the Khmer Rouge and the killing fields that followed, and did so knowing the risks they were&nbsp;running.

<p>
Downloads&nbsp;of <code>epydemic</code>, my <a href="/development/projects/epydemic/">library</a> for epidemic (and other) process
simulation on networks (and hopefully other combinatorial structures
soon…) recently passed&nbsp;100,000.
</p>

<p>
That number comes from the project&#8217;s <a href="https://www.pepy.tech/projects/epydemic">PePy page</a>, which tracks
downloads from the main <a href="https://pypi.org/project/epydemic/">PyPi page</a> as used&nbsp;by <code>pip</code>. I can&#8217;t say
whether or not that number is accurate. Quite honestly it&#8217;s at least
98,000 more than I ever expected, but 100,000 feels like something
of a milestone to be pleased&nbsp;about.
</p>

<p>
<code>epydemic</code> came about because of a lack of standard tooling for doing
epidemic simulation. This involves a lot of stochastic simulation,
which is quite tricky code to write and to make efficient. Testing
the system actually involved us thinking more deeply about the
effectiveness of unit testing for stochastic code, which then led to
a <a href="/softcopy/stochastic-testing-21.pdf">presentation at <span class="caps">UK</span> Systems in 2021</a> explaining the problems we&#8217;d&nbsp;had.

		<p>A Chromebook that behaves like a proper tablet.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>While I do most of my work on a desktop these days, writing and
browsing are better in an easy chair, which is why I became an avid
user of tablets. (I'm too old to read much on a phone.)</p>
<p>I've had two Amazon Fire tablets in recent years. Cheap as chips, but
not all that easy to live with given that they don't run full
Android. The latest one (a Fire 8" HD) I upgraded so that it used a
"proper" app store and had full Google services, but that's still not
entirely seamless.</p>
<p>Then I heard about the Lenovo Duet. A 10" chromebook where the
keyboard detaches and the leaves the screen part as a stand-alone
tablet. It's been done before, but the reviews suggested Lenovo had
managed to get the experience just right. But the real decider was the
price: £320 for 4Gb of RAM and a 128Gb SSD -- for comparison that's
about twice the price of an 8" Fire. I coupled it with a stylus (a £49
Broonel, but any USI stylus should work) and a soft case (£11).</p>
<p><img alt="As a tablet" src="../../../../images/posts/20210408-tablet.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="As a laptop" src="../../../../images/posts/20210408-laptop.jpg"></p>
<p>I've now had this for three months, and the experience is entirely
positive -- with a couple of minor provisos.</p>
<p>Firstly, the positives: it works pretty much perfectly as a
tablet. The build quality of the tablet is excellent.  I've seldom
attached the keyboard, although of course I'm entirely based at home
at the moment next to proper computer, so there's been no call to do
so. Because Chrome OS incorporates Android it has all the apps I need
and more (including some very distracting sketching apps that really
leverage the stylus). The battery life is fantastic, In excess of ten
hours of normal usage.</p>
<p>Chrome OS also now has a full Debian-based Linux disro running under
containerisation, which I haven't fully explored but which I
ascertained early on can run Emacs:</p>
<p><img alt="Running emacs" src="../../../../images/posts/20210408-emacs.jpg"></p>
<p>There are some negatives, although they mostly feel almost churlish at
the price. The keyboard is a bit flimsy, its build quality isn't great
compared to the tablet part, and it's sometimes sensitive to exactly
how it gets attached to the screen. I wouldn't want to use it for much
more than note-taking. The stand is landscape mode only. The
performance isn't fantastic, and it feels sluggish when re-starting
from sleep mode. There are also a few funnies with apps that think
they're on a machine with a keyboard and don't transition to tablet
mode perfectly: 1Password asks you to press Control-Shift-X to unlock
it, for example. I'm sure this will be fixed as dual-mode systems
become more common.</p>
<p>Less trivial is that the USB C port can't drive an external display,
either directly or using a dongle as is the case for the Macbook
Pro. This is rather mystifying in a machine that otherwise would do me
as a laptop replacement: I need to be able to do
presentations. There's apparently <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-display-output-productive">a workaround</a>
to the issue, which I haven't tried and which is unnecessarily baroque
in any case.</p>
<p>All in all, an excellent purchase for anyone wanting a good, cheap
tablet: the keyboard is really just a bonus that's worth having for
even occasional use.</p>
<p>(And what became of the two Fires? The more recent one now acts as a
music streamer in the kitchen, plugged into a powered speaker. The
older one is finding use as a weather station front-end. I like the
fact that these systems are powerful enough and open enough to /have/
such afterlives, so that upgrading doesn't lead immediately to waste.)</p>

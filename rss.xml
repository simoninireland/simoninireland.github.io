Herbert Stoyan.  &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/800055.802047"&gt;Early Lisp History (1956–1959)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;LFP ’84:
Proceedings of the 1984 ACM Symposium on Lisp and Functional
Programming&lt;/i&gt;, pp.299–310. 1984.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A study of Lisp's evolution from first proposal to practical
implementation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It begins with McCarthy's proposal (co-authored with Marvin
Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, and dated 31
August 1955) for a summer research project at Dartmouth College to
"study the relationship of language to intelligence".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In a later (handwritten!) note McCarthy homed-in on the core
challenges in this programme: the lack of a clear way to describe
&lt;i&gt;procedures&lt;/i&gt; to each other (what &lt;a href="https://simondobson.org/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/"&gt;Abelson and Sussman&lt;/a&gt; later refer to
as &lt;i&gt;procedural epistemology&lt;/i&gt;), and the tight binding of programming
systems at that time to specific machines, and hence their need to
bow to engineering (rather than semantic) considerations. The
language that became Lisp sought primarily to overcome these two
challenges.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The journey proceeded by taking the list data structures developed
by Allen Newell and Herb Simon as part of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist"&gt;Logic Theorist&lt;/a&gt; and
embedding them into FORTRAN (for which there was already a working
compiler) – which also incidentally muddied the conceptual waters
by trying to express list and list-functional concepts in a
language built around numbers that barely allowed functions to be
defined by the user at all. Indeed, McCarthy and others had
long-running problems accepting that the list-processing functions
&lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; functions, given that their result does not depend solely on
their arguments when viewed at the lowest level. This shows how
pernicious a low-level implementation can be. The final resulting
language, the FORTRAN List Processing Language (FLPL), shared many
programming approaches function names with what became Lisp.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
McCarthy went on to champion the functional approach, including
the invention of conditional expressions (alongside or replacing
conditional statements) and the power of the different kinds of
function composition and higher-order functions. It's important to
remember that McCarthy's driving interest remained in AI, not
programming languages &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Already in 1956 it was clear that one had to work with symbolic
expressions to reach the goal of artificial intelligence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Which is a fascinating piece of history in itself, as a large
branch of modern AI concerning machine learning and large language
models has explicit rejects this view in favour of sub-symbolic
AI. Which approach is "correct" in whatever sense remains to be
seen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But it remains McCarthy's contributions to programming languages
that stand out. As well as conditional expressions he can be
credited with garbage collection, meta-circular interpretation,
and clarifying the relationship between programming and proof:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should mention here that McCarthy at the same time conceived the
idea of logic-oriented programming, that is, the idea of using logical
formulae to express goals that a program should try to establish and
of using the prover as programming language interpreter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Although it's important to recognise that Newell and Simon's
work, on logic as an application rather than as a general
programming language, pre-dates McCarthy's.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

translated into English 2023.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Includes a history of the route from PLANNER to CONNIVER, in which
the former was criticised for being a theorem prover when a
programming language was needed – an argument between two schools
that's still going on today, as seen in the emergence of &lt;a href="https://lean-lang.org/"&gt;Lean&lt;/a&gt;.

John McCarthy.  &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/lisp.html"&gt;History of Lisp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, Stanford University. 1979.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
McCarthy's own take on the early history. It's quite brief, but is
very careful to give broad credit to the others who were involved
in the practical creation of the language.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's also got some great vignettes on &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; certain features came
about - for example garbage collection coming from the need to
clean up intermediate structures when experimenting with symbolic
differentiation. McCarthy acknowledges taking the notation for
functions from Church, before admitting that he didn't understand
the rest of &lt;i&gt;Calculi of lambda conversion&lt;/i&gt; and so wasn't tempted to
add the more general aspects!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps the most fascinating part of the story is that it was
originally so divorced from actual computers. The team had defined
an &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; function for interpreting Lisp programs – in the process
making the decision to represent the programs as lists – before
realising that this could be made interactive to provide a running
interpreter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What did McCarthy think of his creation? He was conscious that it
would have a lifetime:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
LISP will become obsolete when someone makes a more comprehensive
language that dominates LISP practically and also gives a clear
mathematical semantics to a more comprehensive set of features.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Haskell has a plausible claim to have accomplished the latter but
this doesn't seem to have led domination in practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;"All of Mussolini's monuments will be monuments to the strength of a weakling."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A journalist's account of Mussolini's rise to (and exercise of) power, written by someone who both lived through parts of it and had significant contacts with the man himself. Despite being written at a time when Fascism was still being somewhat celebrated, and even admired, it's quite a scorching read that dismantles many of its pretensions with both observations and data. It would have provided a lot of ammunition to those wanting to avoid fascist takeovers in their ovn countries to read exactly how imaginary the claims of Fascist Italy were, no matter how dramatically and repeatedly proclaimed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprising for a book of its kind and date (it was first published in 1935), Hitler is conspicuous by his absence, mentioned only in passing: there are far more comparisons with Napoleon. It shows how different history looks when lived forwards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The title is interesting: Shirer uses a similar turn of phrase to describe Mussolini in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich_A_History_of_Nazi_Germany" title="The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich A History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; (although he does not reference Seldes as a source). Mussolini's will to power easily overrides any principles he may have had, which makes it hard to decide whether fascism itself had any principles or was simply the inflation of one man's will: Mussolini seems to have been unclear about that himself, but resolving it may be key to understanding the modern trends towards authoritarian politics.

      The lesser-known – now – precursor novel to cyberpunk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A group of rebels engage in pranks and more serious data exfiltration using hallucinatory interfaces to computer-managed information spaces. If that sounds similar to &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6088007.Neuromancer__Sprawl___1_" title="Neuromancer (Sprawl, #1) by William Gibson" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt; then that's because the parallels are unmistakeable. The two books appeared at roughly the same time, and initially &lt;i&gt;True names&lt;/i&gt; seems to have been the more famous: certainly it attracted a lot of attention from some serious people in both tech and sci-fi. It's interesting that &lt;i&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/i&gt; emerged over the longer term as the more significant work: and I think that's deserved, although &lt;i&gt;True names&lt;/i&gt; remains a great read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both books address the issue of information overload and how it could be combatted by using broader-band neural interfaces rather than screens and keyboards. Gibson envisions a rather architectural metaphor, while Vinge goes for something more mythic and fantastical, a world whose practitioners form "covens" and interact with spells and monsters as a way to bring the available functionality into their limited view. It's not something that's actually emerged in what we now think of as cyberspace, which remains resolutely text-driven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My edition of &lt;i&gt;True names&lt;/i&gt; came with essays and an afterward by Marvin Minsky, one of the fathers of AI. The essays in the main haven't aged well, but Minsky's critique of procedural computing still has some bite.

	  (2018)
      &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A take on evolutionary biology that sees cities and human-created environments as a positive force on ecology, without in any way diminishing the effects of human-caused demage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's an interesting perspective. Ecologists and the popular press often only see the damage, not the opportunity, of human construction, and regard species being forced from their "natural" habitats as always bad. Schilthuizen argues quite persuasively that habitat destruction has been mitigated by habitat &lt;i&gt;construction&lt;/i&gt;, by creating urban landscapes in which (often other) species can thrive possibly more than they did before. This is especially true when we also consider "invasive" species transported from elsewhere, which find niches in their destination cities (often around their ports of entry). In some cases we find species that no longer have or inhabit a "natural" habitat at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And habitat destruction often isn't as complete as it seems. Schilthuizen example is the mice of New York's smaller parks, which form islands of isolation that in turn cause identifiable genetic differences between the inhabitants of the different tiny patches of land. Singapore similarly has tiny trats of native forest surrounded by city and cut-off from each other. He uses this carefully to argue that evolution requires neither great distinctions in environment nor wide reaches of time in which to operate in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a careful book that doesn't shy away from the difficult questions that evolution inevitably raises. Plenty of the cases discussed involve a complex mix of genetic evolution, epigenetic adaptation, individual learning, and group-based "culture" to change the animals' relationships with their environments. It's good to take on this complexity head-on, and that makes this stand out as a great introduction and illustration of the wider powers of natural selection.

    &lt;p&gt;
      The Hohenzollerns are usually treated as bookmarks in histories of the two World Wars, with the Kaiser as an essential instigator of the First and laying the groundwork for the Second despite his defenestration. This book picks up his life in exile in the Netherlands as an increasingly anachronistic character unable to handle the need to explain himself even to his own most loyal followers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That loyalty and blindness extends to his descendants, who remain pretenders to leadership well into the Nazi period and attempt to ride the storm while simultaneously keeping a distance from it, unable to accept that they're no longer relevant or even respected except in the most superficial ways. It's as though they want to take credit for Nazi accomplishments and are untroubled by the atrocities as long as it offers the possibility of a return to the throne – and are similarly untroubled by the fact that that thronw would never actually be a real power centre. The Kaiser's emphasis on the forms over the functions of royalty have a long reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The translation is little grating at times, fascinated by the word &lt;i&gt;caesura&lt;/i&gt;. But the pace is good and it deals well with the contradictions and (still continuing) attempts to rewrite family history to remove the taint of association with Hitler – while (coincidentally I'm sure) restoring family property.

      £5 well spent in a charity shop. This is a collection of essays on different historical mysteries. There's something for everyone: the building of Stonehenge, the abandonment of the &lt;i&gt;Mary Celeste&lt;/i&gt;, and (my personal favourite) the fate of the Princes in the Tower. Perhaps a book best dipped into.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the essays haven't aged well against subsequent scholarship.

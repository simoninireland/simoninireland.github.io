&lt;p&gt;
I've recently found myself constantly introducing – and then deleting –
whitespace when writing Lisp. A quick bit of Emacs hacking fixed it.
&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
	You probably have to be a hard-core Unix head to get anywhere with this book – but it's a gem if you are. Kernighan was there throughout what is possoibly the most formative period of computer history, when Unix was developed and many of the paradigms of operating systems and software tools were developed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other books that handle many of the stories in greater detail, but this book is great for the "sweep" of Unix through Bell Labs and out into the world. The memoir parts are perhaps the most interesting, as they illuminate how the various tools came into being and why. There are cameos by people like Richard Hamming, whose own scientific contributions are matched by his insistence that you can only do important work if you first find the important problems, and by both an expected and unexpected cast of pioneers. I'd like to find a similar book on the early years of Lisp showing how decisions that now seem to be inevitable came to be made, and what alternatives there might have been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most hard-core part of the book? It was written using groff, the GNU successor to the roff text formatter than Kernighan himself wrote.

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
	A thoroughly readable narrative history of the First World War and its aftermath. I think the strongest parts are the beginning and end: there's an unavoidable tedium in the middle that reflects the statis of trench warfare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Churchill comes out well, perhaps unsurprisingly in a book by one of his biographers. Later authors place more of the blame for Gallipoli at his door. The American army also comes out well; Pershing, its commender, somewhat less so, as his insistence on having a solely American field army delayed their deployment and in many ways invited disaster in 1918. The Kaiser cuts a sorry figure throughout, belligerent and indecisive and blind to reality right up until the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gilbert is also very strong on the often-overlooked mior allies of both sides. The complexities of Polish and Finnish independence movements, allied to the Central Powers largely in order to defeat Russia, get a lot of exploration, as does the eventual breakup of the Habsburg Empire. The Middle East and the Ottoman Empire are less well-covered. In each case there are clear lines drawn to the peace treaties and the grievances that later gave rise to the Second World War.

      &lt;p&gt;
	Does a fantastic job of explaining an essentially inexplicable movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;QAnon is a conspiracy theory like no other, one that subsumes other conspiracies and morphs into new shapes as its existing tropes and predictions fail to come to pass. It's hard to see it as anything other than a rejection of reason and modernity and the embrace of ... well, nonsense. Rothschild sees it as far more than that, and manages to dive into the abyss without ever becoming lost or tempted to become a believer. He traces the theory's development, from before the first Q "drops" until after Q's disappearence, and draws some historical parallels with previous movements whose failed predictions did little to damage their popularity.

I've been thinking about running &lt;a href="https://jupyter.org"&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt; in the cloud for
some fairly compute-intensive simulation. Specifically I want to do
epidemic and other simulations over complex networks. These are
CPU-intensive and don't make use of GPU acceleration (yet, anyway).
Using the cloud would make things easier to scale-out, especially
for those without access to a local compute cluster.

      &lt;p&gt;
	A masterful telling of modern genetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you know about genetics is wrong: what's how it feels, anyway. The simple story about mutation and inheritance is ... well, not wrong exactly, but woefully incomplete. I think part of the problem is that we lack the right analogies. Genetics is &lt;i&gt;in no way&lt;/i&gt; a blueprint that's simply read when creating life, nor is it &lt;i&gt;in any way&lt;/i&gt; constructed like engineering. Instead it operates at the boundary of chaos, with multiple redundant (and often conflicting) mechanisms finding an uneasy hoeostasis. Genes aren't elementary packets of information, nor does most of the genome consist of them: nor, indeed, is there any well-agreed notion of what a gene actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;. The basic mechanism of RNA reading DNA and then being used to create proteins comes with a set of baroque extensions, as does the supposedly clear notion of heritable characteristics being frozen in the DNA itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all it's amazing that any of it is understood at all – let alone well enough to perform modifications and other feats of modern biotechnology. Arney in many ways achieves the impossible in this book, not hiding the complexity of dumbing it down for a popular audience, but also never getting lost or adding to the inevitable confusion that all this complexity induces even in a scientifically literate reader. I learned a huge amount and had several confusions sorted out for me (to the extent that they are understood at all).

      &lt;p&gt;
	A history of a war without a purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Suez invasion by Britain and France ostensibly took place to separate two warring armies: the Egyptians defending Sinai, and the Israelis who had invaded it. In this is succeeded, in the sense that it stopped the fighting and led to a UN resolution that introduced a more international force to keep the peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except that's not what happened at all. In reality the British, who allegedly took the initiative, followed the French, who had persuaded the Israelis (or been persuaded by them, it's not entirely clear) to provide a pretext to take over the Canal Zone and oust Egyptian President Nasser. The whole enterprise unwound as a result of the USA not supporting, and indeed actively frustrating, its two former allies – much to their surprise. Neither country was strong enough to go it alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading this book it's clear that there never was a clear war aim, or at least not one that was remotely plausible. The intiial plan called for taking Cairo, although no-one was sure that this would accomplish the aim of destroying Nasser's popularity. The revised plan called for occupying the Canal Zone only, which of course had the effect of &lt;i&gt;strengthening&lt;/i&gt; Nasser's hand. Neither the military nor the political leaders seemed to think this through at the time, although many did in the aftermath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fullick and Powell were semi-eyewitnesses on the ground, and are scathing of everything to do with the operation, going so far as to say that it both destroyed British trust in their own government and contributed directly to the fall of the French Fourth Republic. They point out how far the world of Eden and Suez seems to be from the late 1980s when the Suez papers were largely declassified: a world where the solemn work of a Minister was simply accepted, as was the notion that invading Egypt (because it had nationalised the canal) constituted a "just" war.

Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions&lt;/a&gt; – but only because it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a sequel, and so lacks the novelty of the first. It's still a rush, ranging from cosmology down to particle physics, with enough black holes to satisfy anyone. And I also learned about the &lt;a href="https://mybestplace.com/en/article/ussuri-bay-the-most-beautiful-glass-beach-in-the-world" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Glass beach of Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt;, which is a place I'd never imagined existed and made the book worthwhile all on its own, just as Randall said it would.

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6138f82"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've been thinking about running &lt;a href="https://jupyter.org"&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt; in the cloud for
some fairly compute-intensive simulation. Specifically I want to do
epidemic and other simulations over complex networks. These are
CPU-intensive and don't make use of GPU acceleration (yet, anyway).
Using the cloud would make things easier to scale-out, especially
for those without access to a local compute cluster.
&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
	A masterful telling of modern genetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you know about genetics is wrong: what's how it feels, anyway. The simple story about mutation and inheritance is ... well, not wrong exactly, but woefully incomplete. I think part of the problem is that we lack the right analogies. Genetics is &lt;i&gt;in no way&lt;/i&gt; a blueprint that's simply read when creating life, nor is it &lt;i&gt;in any way&lt;/i&gt; constructed like engineering. Instead it operates at the boundary of chaos, with multiple redundant (and often conflicting) mechanisms finding an uneasy hoeostasis. Genes aren't elementary packets of information, nor does most of the genome consist of them: nor, indeed, is there any well-agreed notion of what a gene actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;. The basic mechanism of RNA reading DNA and then being used to create proteins comes with a set of baroque extensions, as does the supposedly clear notion of heritable characteristics being frozen in the DNA itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all it's amazing that any of it is understood at all – let alone well enough to perform modifications and other feats of modern biotechnology. Arney in many ways achieves the impossible in this book, not hiding the complexity of dumbing it down for a popular audience, but also never getting lost or adding to the inevitable confusion that all this complexity induces even in a scientifically literate reader. I learned a huge amount and had several confusions sorted out for me (to the extent that they are understood at all).

      &lt;p&gt;
	A history of a war without a purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Suez invasion by Britain and France ostensibly took place to separate two warring armies: the Egyptians defending Sinai, and the Israelis who had invaded it. In this is succeeded, in the sense that it stopped the fighting and led to a UN resolution that introduced a more international force to keep the peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except that's not what happened at all. In reality the British, who allegedly took the initiative, followed the French, who had persuaded the Israelis (or been persuaded by them, it's not entirely clear) to provide a pretext to take over the Canal Zone and oust Egyptian President Nasser. The whole enterprise unwound as a result of the USA not supporting, and indeed actively frustrating, its two former allies – much to their surprise. Neither country was strong enough to go it alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading this book it's clear that there never was a clear war aim, or at least not one that was remotely plausible. The intiial plan called for taking Cairo, although no-one was sure that this would accomplish the aim of destroying Nasser's popularity. The revised plan called for occupying the Canal Zone only, which of course had the effect of &lt;i&gt;strengthening&lt;/i&gt; Nasser's hand. Neither the military nor the political leaders seemed to think this through at the time, although many did in the aftermath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fullick and Powell were semi-eyewitnesses on the ground, and are scathing of everything to do with the operation, going so far as to say that it both destroyed British trust in their own government and contributed directly to the fall of the French Fourth Republic. They point out how far the world of Eden and Suez seems to be from the late 1980s when the Suez papers were largely declassified: a world where the solemn work of a Minister was simply accepted, as was the notion that invading Egypt (because it had nationalised the canal) constituted a "just" war.

Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions (What If?, #1) by Randall Munroe" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions&lt;/a&gt; – but only because it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a sequel, and so lacks the novelty of the first. It's still a rush, ranging from cosmology down to particle physics, with enough black holes to satisfy anyone. And I also learned about the &lt;a href="https://mybestplace.com/en/article/ussuri-bay-the-most-beautiful-glass-beach-in-the-world" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Glass beach of Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt;, which is a place I'd never imagined existed and made the book worthwhile all on its own, just as Randall said it would.

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
	The sub-title is more accurate than the title. This isn't an official history – but it reads like one, being much ore concerned with who ran which sections, the committees and organograms of SOE than with the actual secret war it prosecuted so well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the in-fighting described is inevitable, such as the tensions between SOE and MI6. An intelligence service needs quiet; a sabotage service is devoted to exactly the opposite, and so tends to disrupt intelligence-gathering by attracting the attentions of counter-intelligence services. This explains, but doesn't excuse, the hostility and machinations of MI6, which created a bureaucratic war weakening the abilities of both services to fight the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; war. It's an interesting case study in how hard it is to create organisations, even when involved in an existential fight.

&lt;h2 id="orgdd2a433"&gt;TIL: Stroke order of Chinese surnames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdd2a433"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes we publish papers with authors in alphabetical order;
sometimes we use an order based on contribution, typically the main
author (often the most junior) first followed by the lesser
contributors and culminating in the most senior author, who might not
have made many concrete contributions to the writing. Personally I'm
a firm believer in the second style.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But I always wondered: how does one list authors in alphabetical
order for languages like Chinese that are non-alphabetic? I had the
opportunity to ask a couple of Chinese colleagues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While Chinese doesn't have an &lt;i&gt;alphabetical&lt;/i&gt; order, it can use a
&lt;i&gt;stroke&lt;/i&gt; order: some surnames require more strokes than others,
often significantly more (four &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; eleven, in the case of the
two colleagues who explained this to me). So one can list authors in
order of the increasing numbers of strokes needed to write their
surnames.  That's really clever, and no more or less arbitrary in
terms of author appearance than the alphabetic approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
	A book about pain, and why it isn't what we think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conventional wisdom is that pain is caused by damage, but it's more subtle than that. Pain is a &lt;i&gt;signal&lt;/i&gt; that can be triggered by damage, but can also be caused in response to less physical causes such as fear and a memory of past damage – and can be suppressed by activity or positive thinking, at least to a degree. This is awkward ground, as Lyman recognises: it's close to saying that "it's all in the mind", which is both literally true and deeply offensive to those suffering persistent pain. But it also offers hope that enormously dangerous pharmaceuticals can – sometimes – be replaced or complemented with cognitive therapies that might be effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has had the experience of being deeply engaged in some activity, incurring damage, and not noticing until afterwards. Soldiers frequently report it: they also sometimes feel significantly less pain from their injuries than civilians, because an injury that takes you off the battlefield makes you &lt;i&gt;safer than you were&lt;/i&gt;. The signals get mixed, and the pain felt changes accordingly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's much to like in this book, not least a very thorough treatment of placebos. It does sometimes get lost in reporting yet another clinical trial, or yet another insight into neurochemistry. It sometimes feels a little too long and too well-referenced for a popular science take on the issues.

      &lt;p&gt;
	A book on grand strategy and its application to less-grand challenges in a world dominated by networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The central thesis of this book is that the world of hierarchies and direct state-to-state diplomacy – the chessboard – is giving way to a much more nuanced world in which state and non-state actors interact and co-operate in far ore complex ways – the web. The network effects change everything, from the nature of power and how it's used to the nature of leadership and how one can actually get things done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's interesting to see the concepts of network science being applied to social and political science in a way that doesn't trivialise them. The applications range from analysis of interaction patterns to trying to engineer particular interactions such as improving information sharing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's an obvious comparison to &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26245038.The_Seventh_Sense_Power__Fortune__and_Survival_in_the_Age_of_Networks" title="The Seventh Sense Power, Fortune, and Survival in the Age of Networks by Joshua Cooper Ramo" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Seventh Sense: Power, Fortune, and Survival in the Age of Networks&lt;/a&gt;, with which Slaughter contrasts her work, she being a "Wilsonian" humanist &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; Joshua Ramo's "Kissingerian" realist. Slaughter's view is that there is a need for more understanding of how small-scale interactions can happen – contrasting with Ramo's desire for aggressive "gatekeeping" of a US-led networked order. I can't help thinking that her view is more realistic and democratic.

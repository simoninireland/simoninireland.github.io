&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This a really brief, yet really interesting, approach to
introducing Lisp to someone. Interesting because it covers all the
usual ground, but also has copious pointers to other material
slightly-beyond-introductory ("Where to go from here"). It also
links to material that's essential to modern practice, such as
Lisp packages and systems, and the essential "standard libraries"
such as Alexandria, Bordeaux, CL-PPCRE, usocket, and the like: the
things that are needed in practice and which in other languages
would probably be built-in and included directly in an
introduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org5c9d58a"&gt;First installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5c9d58a"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The BirdNET-Pi system aims to provide out-of-the-box bird
identification. It's slightly more awkward than that, but still
pretty straightforward to get up and running.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My first hardware plan was to use a Raspberry Pi Zero as the
compute host with a &lt;a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wm8960-audio-hat.htm"&gt;Waveshare WM8960 HAT&lt;/a&gt; for the sound capture. It
turns out that BirdNET needs a 64-bit platform – why I'm not sure
– and the Pi Zero only runs 32-bit Linux. I therefore moved to a
Raspberry Pi B that I had lying around, and put a 64-bit "lite"
install on it to run headless.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I then basically just followed the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Installation-Guide"&gt;installation guide&lt;/a&gt;. There was an
issue with the installation script when cloning the GitHub repo: I
suspect this was because of limited memory on the Pi. I downloaded
manually, and manually ran the rest of the install script, which did
a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of setup of services and a PHP web server.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I compiled the &lt;a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/WM8960_Audio_HAT"&gt;drivers&lt;/a&gt; for the HAT, which worked fine. The new
sound card is recognised but is not the system default.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The installed components seem to include:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;icecast2&lt;/code&gt;, a streaming server, used to replay recordings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;caddy&lt;/code&gt; web server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP for serving the web pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;arecord&lt;/code&gt; to actually record audio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; to extract waveforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqlite for the database&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the actual machine learning model used for recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The recognition models are built with TensorFlow. This is a great
example of how the standard Linux tools and services can be combined
to get a scientific-grade sensor platform. (Caddy doesn't seem to be
running over TLS by default, which would be an issue outside a
firewall.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since the sound card isn't the default, the easiest way to get the
system listening to the right mics is to change the device in the
"advanced settings" panel: in my case I changed from "default" to
"hw:2,0", reflecting the output of &lt;code&gt;arecord -l&lt;/code&gt; that shows the sound
card devices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I then deployed the Pi out of the kitchen window.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://simondobson.org/attachments/18/408cf7-5f1f-4b07-81ef-e8f94d1c38d3/screenshot.png" alt="nil"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To start with it wasn't hearing anything, which I think may be
because of the waterfall in the courtyard: turning this off made
things much more effective:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://simondobson.org/attachments/18/408cf7-5f1f-4b07-81ef-e8f94d1c38d3/screenshot-1.png" alt="nil"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's an appropriate set of birds being seen – and we hardly ever
&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; magpies, but know they're around. There's actually quite a lot
of background noise even in such a quiet village, but the bird
calls do stand out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I can't see any reason for the manual installation on bare metal:
as far as I can see everything could be containerised, which would
make deployment and management a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org74f003b"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Downloads of &lt;code&gt;epydemic&lt;/code&gt;, my &lt;a href="/development/projects/epydemic/"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; for epidemic (and other) process
simulation on networks (and hopefully other combinatorial structures
soon…) recently passed 100,000.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That number comes from the project's &lt;a href="https://www.pepy.tech/projects/epydemic"&gt;PePy page&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks
downloads from the main &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/epydemic/"&gt;PyPi page&lt;/a&gt; as used by &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;. I can't say
whether or not that number is accurate. Quite honestly it's at least
98,000 more than I ever expected, but 100,000 feels like something
of a milestone to be pleased about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;epydemic&lt;/code&gt; came about because of a lack of standard tooling for doing
epidemic simulation. This involves a lot of stochastic simulation,
which is quite tricky code to write and to make efficient. Testing
the system actually involved us thinking more deeply about the
effectiveness of unit testing for stochastic code, which then led to
a &lt;a href="/softcopy/stochastic-testing-21.pdf"&gt;presentation at UK Systems in 2021&lt;/a&gt; explaining the problems we'd
had.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org69b2fff"&gt;TIL: The loudest Lisp program in the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org69b2fff"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I learned about a program that generates the sounds that help
people navigate as they exit long tunnels when an emergency such as
a fire has destroyed the visibility.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blog.funcall.org//lisp%20psychoacoustics/2024/05/01/worlds-loudest-lisp-program/"&gt;The World's Loudest Lisp Program to the Rescue&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This describes the challenges of building a software system that has
to work unmonitored once deployed, for years, as well as
withstanding a fairly rugged environment where, for example, the
installedc hardware will be periodically sprayed with a
high-pressure hose as the walls get cleaned. Overall the system is
soft real-time, but has to cope with component failure, network
partitions, consensus, and all the usual distributed systems
challenges, while be guaranteed to work when needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The developers built the system in Common Lisp, which wouldn't be
the normal go-to choice for an embedded system. But their argument
was that they could better handle complex and changing requirements
by retaining a high level of abstraction, and that development was
overall far faster than using C. Modern Common Lisp compilers are so
efficient that there's no significant performance hit at deployment.
They made use of complicated components like planners (for which
Lisp is an ideal choice), and built a set of macros to wrap-up the
handling of industrial control and robust communications.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a great read.
&lt;/p&gt;

      The space race from the American perspective is well-known: this book presents the same race from the Soviet perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The differences are profound, of course, mainly driven by the Soviet programme occurring in complete secrecy to duck the risks that failure would have on the programme's image. The American programme by contrast was conducted in the open at least as far as the actual "shots" were concerned – and their public failures did indeed endanger their ability to continue, at least in part because neither public nor politicians understood the process of engineering or just how &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt; each shot was. The deep irony is that the Soviet successes appeared so sudden and dramatic they led directly to the deepening of the American programme and commitment or more money and effort than the Soviets seemed able to maintain to capitalise on their early lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are plenty of revelations even for those with a detailed interest in space history. I remember hearing all through the 1970s that the Soviet spacecraft landed on land, but it turns out that in many cases the cosmonauts were bailing-out and parachuting to earth instead, with this being intensively covered-up even to the extent of falsifying reports to the international organisation responsible for certifying "firsts" in space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the achievements of both programmes were profound, they were perhaps doomed in the long term by a lack of vision for what they were actually &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;. The benefits of space technology are now obvious; those of exploration perhaps less so, although it doesn't (in my opinion) require much suspension of disbelief to feel that science-driven activities lead almost inevitably to enormously valuable spin-offs. The fact that we can't quantify these &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; shouldn't (in my opinion, again) stop us keeping the faith in the value of experiments that advance our science &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; engineering in ways that wouldn't otherwise happen.

      A very technical examination of the world's first numerical weather "prediction" – although in fact it was really a "postdiction", taking detailed data and using it to compute a scenario that could be compared against a known ground truth. It was an incredible achievement anyway, performing manually and at low resolution the calculations now routinely performed by computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richardson was the person who saw that this would be possible, realising that the physics and mathematics could be solved even though the computational capabilities didn't exist. In this he foresaw the emergence of the modern power of data, where the existence of more and better data transforms both the way we do science and the sciene that we do. It's something that should put him alongside Turing and Von Neumann as visionaries of what computation could achieve.

Could social media posts be actively damaging to our mental health?
– literally, not just figuratively? That's the premise of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/09/techscape-deepfakes-cognitohazards-science-fiction"&gt;a
TechScape article in The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, that draws on both science
fiction and psychological research.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In Neal Stephenson's "Snow crash" there is a plot device of an image
in a metaverse that, when viewed, crashes the viewer's brain. We
haven't seen this in social media (yet), but there's an increasing
concern about deepfake images and other forms of misinformation.
Research suggests that such images are damaging &lt;i&gt;even if viewers
know that they're fakes&lt;/i&gt;, which suggests that techniques like
content-labelling images as AI-generated are insufficient to remove
their harm. Other examples include massively engaging artificial
images such as the "pong wars" animation of two simultaneous
"Breakout" games going on between two algorithms: something that
shouldn't be as engaging as it is (as I can attest to myself).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Social media attention grabbing at an industrial scale might
therefore constitute a &lt;i&gt;cognitohazard&lt;/i&gt;, a way of hacking people's
brains simply by being viewed.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The history of what is still as I write this an ongoing scandal: perhaps the greatest miscarriage of justice in UK history, when the Post Office turned on and prosecuted its own operators for fraud on the basis of flawed evidence from its Horizon IT system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scandal came from a series of interlocking arrangements. The Post Office could mount prosecutions in its own right (something that its management now claims to have been unaware of), with its own investigators able to interview under caution but seemingly not required to record interviews or allow legal representation. The contracts under which postmasters operated were mis-represented to turn any discrepancies into the postmasters' fault, while simultaneously denying them the data they'd need to investigate themselves unless they were exceptionally careful and persistent – and the few who &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; were prosecuted and driven out anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a computer scientist I have to say that the most ridiculous part of the story is the presumption in law that a computer system works properly absent explicit to the contrary, that – when coupled with an asymmetry of who can access to software and its logs – makes it impossible to fight against computer-generated evidence. No system of this size &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; works flawlessly, and a careful designer would add features on that assumption, such as paper-trails or detailed logs that can then be forensically analysed. Equally, no such system would ever be constructed without remote access to terminal endpoints to allow problems to be remotely fixed, and again a careful designer would ensure that such interventions were logged so as to be auditable. This is so self-evident that I find it hard to believe that Horizon &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt; designed that way, which makes the repeated denials even more suspicious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there's a social commentary here too. The justice system, juries, and the communities of the prosecuted postmasters were almost eager to believe their guilt. Part of that was the lack of proper media scrutiny to bring the extent of prosecutions into the public eye, and part due to obfuscation by the Post Office itself – but it surely there should be systemic oversight of such things, given the massive consequences. And surely communities should have been less ready to believe accusations made against their own members that went against the evidence of their own eyes.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While pitched as a way of sharing the author's enthusiasm for Lisp
(which really shines through), this book is really a deep
demonstration in using Lisp in modern applications – from web
APIs and the semantic web to deep learning, large language models,
and chatbots.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In some ways, like many other Lisp books, it's really two books in
one. The first chapters are introductory – and to be perfectly
honest could be dispensed with, as they're inadequate as a proper
introduction and there are far better introductions out there. The
later chapters focus on applications, and provide the real value.
One could criticise them as often tying-together tools in other
languages, with the Lisp code basically being glue; but that's a
very effective way of leveraging all the code and services out
there, and is an important technique for Lisp programmers too.

<h4>Research&nbsp;Topic</h4>
Increasingly in data-driven enterprises, organisations are having to cope with a wide variety of information sources and standards, leading to a lack of interoperability and increasing data integration costs. Resulting labour-intensive data integration practices are brittle in the face of accelerating innovation in data-driven applications and growing demand for agile data analytics. At the same time organisations must react to increasing public and legislative focus on privacy and data protection. Empowering users to control the information that flows around them in a privacy-sensitive and personalised manner also offers many challenges.

These 5 PhD positions will advance the state of the art in linked data, semantic web and personalisation technologies to explore new approaches to data integration that are self-managing (towards autonomic), and in addition explore new ways to deliver personalised multimodal information (towards a digital companion).

These posts are part of the new <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> Centre (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.adaptcentre.ie">http://www.adaptcentre.ie</a>). <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> has received €50 Million research funding from Industry and Science Foundation Ireland to support 120 researchers across 4 universities in Dublin. The <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> Centre’s mission is to produce world class research that delivers disruptive innovations for the digital media and intelligent content industry. These PhD positions will be supervised by a member of the following <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> Centre academics; Professor Vincent Wade, Professor Declan O’Sullivan, Professor Dave Lewis, Professor Owen Conlan and Dr Rob Brennan.

<span class="caps">ADAPT</span> is Ireland’s global centre of excellence for digital content and media innovation. Led by <span class="caps">TCD</span>, it combines the expertise of researchers at four universities (Trinity College Dublin, Dublin City University, University College Dublin, and Dublin Institute of Technology) with that of its industry partners to produce ground-breaking digital content innovation.

<span class="caps">ADAPT</span> brings together more than 120 researchers who collectively have won more than €100m in funding and have a strong track record of transferring world-leading research and innovations to more than 140 companies. With <span class="caps">EURO</span> 50M in new research funding from Science Foundation Ireland and industry, <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> is seeking talented individuals to join its growing research team. Our research and technologies will continue to help businesses in all sectors and drive back the frontiers of future Web engagement.
<h4>Why join <span class="caps">ADAPT</span> @&nbsp;<span class="caps">TCD</span></h4>
<ul>

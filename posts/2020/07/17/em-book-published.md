It's been a rewarding journey that's taught me a lot, not least about
the process of self-publications. For anyone thinking of going the
same route with a similarly maths- and code-driven book I've also
written about [the process](/blog/2020/07/22/self-publishing/), the
toolchain and other elements required to get into print.

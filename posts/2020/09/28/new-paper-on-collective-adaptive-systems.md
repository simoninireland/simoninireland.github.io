Our paper "On the social implications of complex adaptive systems" was
just published in IEEE Technology and Society Magazine.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

This paper arose out of a workshop I attended at the Symposium on
Self-Adaptive and Self-organising Systems (SASO) in 2019 in Trento,
IT. The basic issue of how to design systems whose components were
both humans and computational processes, and how to understand the
ways in which these systems might adapt to changing circumstances.

The main challenge, of course, is understanding how to integrate
largely uncontrollable and unpredictable human behaviour into a system
description: how to you capture what someone *should* do (but might
not), and the implications for the system if they don't? (Not to
mention how to decide whether they did or not.) This notion of
"designing with and for" and quite fascinating, and ties into wider
notions of how computer-aided human processes might behave: will they
be more, or less, reliable and responsive than either fully automated
or fully manual systems in particular scenarios?

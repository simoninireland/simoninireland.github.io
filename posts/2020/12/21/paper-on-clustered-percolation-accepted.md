Our paper "Percolation on random graphs with higher-order clustering"
was accepted into *Physical Review E*.

<!-- TEASER_END-->

This paper has been around quite a lot of reviewing cycles to get it
right, and they've made it enormously stronger than when we first
[submitted it](/blog/2020/06/25/two-papers-on-clustered-networks/)
five months ago.

The paper looks at how clustering of a network affects the formation
of a giant component when conducting percolation -- which is something
that also has huge importance in disease modelling, as percolation is
closely relate mathematically to how diseases spread. The main result
is that clustering -- where there are triangles, squares and other
cycles, as well as cliques and similar structures that "densify" the
network locally -- have an effect on the threshold at which
percolation happens or at which disease break out.

This is the basic work behind our recently-accepted
[applications paper](/blog/2020/12/03/random-graphs-clustering/),
which uses a slightly extended theory to look at the ways in which
these properties interact with *other* features commonly found in
real-world networks.

It's been a great few months for this work, and all credit belongs to
Peter, my PhD student and the main author on both papers, for
hanging-in when it seemed we might not make it into the venue we targeted.

I gave a talk by Zoom to the [Institute of Mathematics and its Applications](https://ima.org.uk)
arising from my epidemic modelling [book](/writing/em-book/).

UPDATED 2020-12-29: You can now find a video of the talk on the
[IMA's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apR_qD2tOkU).

It was a great opportunity to create a general-audience talk from the
work I did during the first lockdown, including some of the maths of
discrete-event simulation that underlie [``epydemic``](/development/epydemic/).
I also spent some time talking about the "waterfall" phase transition
that I found when looking at test-and-trace approaches.

In retrospect I slightly regret including this in the book, as it's
the one thing I'm not *sure* about: I still don't know if this is a
"real" phenomenon or an artefact of simulation.

I got some nice questions, mainly focused on the covid-19 pandemic as
you'd expect in the current times. Apparently there were about 75
attendees form the UK, China, Germany, France, and Spain: the pandemic
has been great for attendance at these virtual events! It's something
that I hope persists as the pandemic subsides.

* Lisp as a second language

  Perspectives on New Music *20*, pp.192â€“222. 1990.

  In some ways this article should come under "applications", as
  it's mainly concerned with using Lisp to represent and manipulate
  music. Indeed, it presents a system that can be used to perform
  all sorts of common transformations of the tones and timing of a
  piece. It's easy to see how the resulting system could be used to
  compose and then to drive instruments, for example through a MIDI
  interface.

  The music perspective is however secondary to the goal of teaching
  and showcasing Lisp through the medium of a realistic example of
  symbolic programming. It covers a lot of ground, starting with
  lists and functions and including first-class functions and
  combinators as means of implementing the musical structures. It's
  a great piece of pedagogy that treats the application and the
  language as closely linked, and not shying-away from some quite
  advanced techniques that have clear applications in the domain. It
  would be great to see this used as a basis for actual musical
  composition and performance.

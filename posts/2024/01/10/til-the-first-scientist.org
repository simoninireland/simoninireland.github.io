* TIL: The first scientist

  Today I learned that [[https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/10/20/mary-somerville/][the first person ever to be called a
  "scientist"]] was the Scottish ... erm, scientist [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville][Mary Sommerville]]
  (1780--1872), who made discoveries across several fields of
  mathematics, physics, and astronomy, and was one of the first two
  women admitted to membership of the Royal Astronomical Society.

  It was the fact that she was both a woman and a polymath that led to
  the need for a new word. She clearly wasn't a "man of science", as
  was the common description; nor did she fall into the accepted
  classes such as geologist or chemist, since she contributed to all
  these fields and more. So [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whewell][William Whewell]], the Master of Trinity
  College, Cambridge, and the person who had introduced one of
  Sommerville's books to the university's maths curriculum, decided to
  unify all these specific classes into the new general category of
  /scientist/. (He also introduced the terms /physicist/ and
  /linguistics/.)

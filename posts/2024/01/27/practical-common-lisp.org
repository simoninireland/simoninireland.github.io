  Peter Seibel.  /[[https://gigamonkeys.com/book/][Practical Common Lisp]]/. Apress. ISBN
  978-1-4302-0017-8. 2005.

  The classic, very thorough and hands-on tutorial introduction that
  doesn't skip the hard parts like the condition system and
  non-local blocks and exists (and the relationship between the
  two). It's also got good chapters on CLOS.

  The text is complemented by a set of modern examples, for web
  services, database, and binary file parsers: quite a long way
  removed from the examples in many introductory texts. It doesn't
  make much use of macro programming in these examples, which is a
  shame, so follow with [[link:/2024/07/05/on-lisp/][On Lisp]] or [[link:/2024/07/05/let-over-lambda/][Let over Lambda]] once the structure
  of the language is clear.

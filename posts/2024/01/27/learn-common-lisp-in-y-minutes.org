* Learn Common Lisp in Y minutes                                  :PUBLISHED:

  https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/common-lisp/

  A one-web-page introduction to Common Lisp covering pretty much
  all the language in enough detail to at least start writing simple
  command-line programs (and understanding those of others).
  Includes macros and CLOS. Quite an achievement to make it all so
  readable.

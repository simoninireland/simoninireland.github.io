  Robert Wilensky.  /LISPcraft/. W.W. Norton. ISBN
  0-393-95442-0. 1984.

  Hard to know whether to include this as an introduction or
  collection of applications, since it runs all the way from basic
  uses to pattern-matching and associative retrieval, by way of the
  non-list data types in Lisp, and includes discussion of the symbol
  table and other internals that definitely fall into the "advanced"
  category.

  However, this was my second introduction to Lisp (after [[link:/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/][SICP]]), so
  it has a fond place in my memory. The fact that it deals with
  language internals isn't a bad thing, because it deals with the
  basics so well. It's very much a traditional programming
  introduction focusing on the "needed" parts of the language. It
  pre-dates the Common Lisp standard and doesn't touch on CLOS,
  which perhaps make it a less appropriate choice for newcomers
  these days than [[link:/2024/01/27/practical-common-lisp/][Practical Common Lisp]].

  -----

  There is also a second edition. I haven't read it, but it seems that
  it addresses at least the concern about being non-standard:

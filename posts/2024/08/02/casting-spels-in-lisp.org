* Casting SPELs in Lisp

  https://www.lisperati.com/casting.html

  A tongue-in-cheek -- but still excellent -- comicbook-style
  introduction to Lisp programming. (There's also a version
  [[https://www.lisperati.com/casting-spels-emacs/html/casting-spels-emacs-1.html][specifically for Emacs Lisp]].) It's structured around building an
  adventure-style game, which as well as being a classic also offers
  lots of opportunities for exploring different data structures and
  algorithms: one can easily imagine expanding it to include (for
  example) an AI second player or autonomous non-player characters
  and gradually building a really complicated application from a
  standing start.

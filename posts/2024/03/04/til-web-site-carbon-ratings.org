* TIL: Web site carbon ratings                                       :ATTACH:

  Today I learned about a site that rates web pages according to their
  carbon footprints.

  My web site does well:

  I'm not all that surprised by this, since I [[link:/development/this-site/][use]] a static site
  generator and minimal (almost no) JavaScript: basically as low-power
  as one could get.

  The [[https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/simondobson-org/][full report]] includes an approximate carbon cost per page visit
  (60mg), and even tries to work out the underlying energy provision,
  dirty or renewable -- dirty in my case at the moment, unfortunately.
  (I'm currently hosted on GitHub.) I should perhaps take the hint and
  move onto an alternative provider, or even host it myself with a
  solar-powered Raspberry Pi. [[https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/][Low-tech Magazine]] does this, but they
  /are/ based in Barcelona rather than Scotland...

  You can even include a badge that reports your rating "live":

  #+begin_export html
  <div id="wcb" class="carbonbadge"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/website-carbon-badges@1.1.3/b.min.js" defer></script>
  #+end_export

  (It caches so as to only make one request per day.) On the other
  hand this increases the JavaScript footprint slightly, so I don't
  think I'll be using it anywhere apart from just here.

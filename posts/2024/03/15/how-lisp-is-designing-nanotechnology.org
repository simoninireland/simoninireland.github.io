* How Lisp is designing nanotechnology

  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fytGL8vzGeQ][How Lisp is designing nanotechnology]] (video, 52 minutes).

  An interview on the [[https://www.youtube.com/@DeveloperVoices][Developer Voices]] podcast with [[https://www.schafmeistergroup.com/][Prof Christian
  Schafmeister]] on designing enzymes using a custom dialect of Lisp
  to control computational chemistry libraries.

  He initially started from an idea based on CAD applications
  (written in Smalltalk), but rapidly realised there were too many
  possible components and combinations to work with graphically and
  so started treating it as a language-design problem -- and
  designed a custom Lisp based on [[https://ecl.common-lisp.dev/][ECL]]. Lisp provides simplicity and
  efficiency, as well as being a "forever" language in which
  software keeps working over the long term.

  Vsevolod Dyomkin.  /[[https://leanpub.com/lisphackers][Lisp Hackers: Interviews with 100x More Productive
  Programmers]]/. Leanpub. 2013.

  I'm not convinced by the sub-title: at the very least, there's no
  evidence to support the claim that Lisp programmers really are
  hundreds of time more productive. But there are some serious
  insights here from individuals who've made serious contributions
  to the Lisp world -- and beyond. The contributions all take the
  form of email interviews consisting of a standard prelude of
  questions (how did you discover Lisp?, do you use it at work?)
  followed by a couple of questions tailored to the interviewee.

  The practitioners selected have all been affected by Lisp, either
  in terms of it changing their own thought processes, or by helping
  to develop the core ecosystem, or by applying Lisp to real-world
  problems, and often to great effect. My favourite was the
  discussion with someone who was using Common Lisp to develop
  low-latency network routing for financial services: it's hard
  to think of a better example of Lisp's power and range.

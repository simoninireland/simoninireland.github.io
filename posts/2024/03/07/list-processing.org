* List processing

  J.M. Foster.  /List Processing/. Macdonald and Co. 1967.

  A slim volume discussing list processing with reference to Lisp
  and to other list processing systems of the time (including some
  libraries embedded into Fortran).

  The most fascinating part of the book is its bibliography, which
  references a lot of papers that have disappeared from the
  collective memory of computer science, but whose implications
  were profound.

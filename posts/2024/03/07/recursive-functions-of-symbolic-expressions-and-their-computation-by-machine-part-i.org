* Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine, Part I

  John McCarthy.  /[[https://doi.org/10.1145/367177.367199][Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and
  Their Computation by Machine, Part I]]/. Communications of the ACM
  *3*, pp.184â€“195. 1960.

  The original Lisp paper from 1960, which opens:

  #+begin_quote
  A programming system called LISP (for LISt Processor) has been
  developed for the IBM 704 computer...
  #+end_quote

  The paper then proceeds to lay out everything that's since been
  built on: the basic constructs, the use of cons cells (pairs) as a
  data representation, the world's first garbage collection algorithm,
  an equational semantics, and ideas for interpretation and
  compilation. It's awesome, and humbling to read it and realise its
  age and the vision of computing it developed.

  (Despite this paper being labelled Part I, incidentally, there
  isn't a part II.)

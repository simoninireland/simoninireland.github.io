  Peter Norvig.  /[[https://norvig.github.io/paip-lisp/][Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming:
  Case Studies in Common Lisp]]/. Morgan Kaufmann. 1992.

  An absolute classic of both AI and Lisp, and really two books in
  one. The applications presented cover the entire range of
  "classic" AI up to the late 90s: expert systems, logic
  programming, symbolic mathematics, knowledge representation,
  constraint programming, game search, syntax-driven natural
  language processing, and more.

  It uses Lisp as the programming vehicle, and doesn't shy-away from
  depth, dealing with the effects of garbage collection (and how to
  program effectively in its presence), the effects of different
  representations, low-level optimisation and disassembly, and all
  the approaches one needs to use Lisp in real, scalable practice.

  Edmund Weitz.  /[[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-1176-2][Common Lisp Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach]]/.
  Apress. 2016.

  An extensive list of recipes for using common data structures,
  how the differ in Lisp from the equivalents in other languages,
  and what novel features Lisp has to offer. A great place to start
  when moving away from being a beginner, and for dipping into in
  search of solutions.

  It's probably strongest on the "gotchas" and dangers that Lisp
  presents, but also has a lot to say about coding style and code
  optimisation.

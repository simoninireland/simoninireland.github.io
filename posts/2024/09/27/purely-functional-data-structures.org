* Purely functional data structures

  Chris Okasaki. /Purely Functional Data Structures/. Cambridge
  University Press. ISBN 978-051153-010-4. 1998.

  Not a Lisp book /per se/, but a treatment of data structures from a
  functional programming perspective. The code examples are in
  Standard ML, but the ideas apply strongly to Lisp and Scheme.
  Definitely a useful source for an alternative take on data
  structuring that doesn't start from assumptions of imperative
  programming and mutability.

* A road to Common Lisp

  [[https://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/][A Road to Common Lisp]]

  This a really brief, yet really interesting, approach to
  introducing Lisp to someone. Interesting because it covers all the
  usual ground, but also has copious pointers to other material
  slightly-beyond-introductory ("Where to go from here"). It also
  links to material that's essential to modern practice, such as
  Lisp packages and systems, and the essential "standard libraries"
  such as Alexandria, Bordeaux, CL-PPCRE, usocket, and the like: the
  things that are needed in practice and which in other languages
  would probably be built-in and included directly in an
  introduction.

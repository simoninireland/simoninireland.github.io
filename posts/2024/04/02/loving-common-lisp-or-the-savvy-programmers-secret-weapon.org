  Mark Watson.  /[[https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp][Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmerâ€™s Secret
  Weapon]]/. Leanpub. 2023.

  While pitched as a way of sharing the author's enthusiasm for Lisp
  (which really shines through), this book is really a deep
  demonstration in using Lisp in modern applications -- from web
  APIs and the semantic web to deep learning, large language models,
  and chatbots.

  In some ways, like many other Lisp books, it's really two books in
  one. The first chapters are introductory -- and to be perfectly
  honest could be dispensed with, as they're inadequate as a proper
  introduction and there are far better introductions out there. The
  later chapters focus on applications, and provide the real value.
  One could criticise them as often tying-together tools in other
  languages, with the Lisp code basically being glue; but that's a
  very effective way of leveraging all the code and services out
  there, and is an important technique for Lisp programmers too.

The Brazilian government is funding studentships for Brazilian nationals with a range of international universities and disciplines. The studentships are "co-tutelle", being split between an international and a Brazilian host university, and aim to improve international collaboration as well as enhancing the student experience.

A number of Schools at St Andrews  are <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/scholarships/brazil/">part of this programme</a>, ranging across the physical and biological sciences in areas in which we have international-quality research. In Computer Science, we have <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/scholarships/brazil/computerscience/">a wide range of project proposals on offer</a> covering all our main research activities. Interested students should contact the supervisors offering the proposed projects to check on suitability and availability. All students will be subject to the University's usual rules on quality and eligibility.</p></body></html>

<a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research">http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research</a>

We are looking for highly-motivated research students with an  interest in these exciting areas. Our only requirements are  that the proposed research would be good, we have staff to supervise it,  and that you would be good at doing it. We have up to six funded  studentships available for students interested in working towards a PhD.  The studentships offer costs of fees and an annual tax-free maintenance  stipend of about £13,590 per year for 3.5 years. Exceptionally well  qualified and able students may be awarded an enhanced stipend of an  additional £2,000 per year. Students should normally have or expect at  least an upper-2nd class Honours degree or Masters degree in Computer  Science or a related discipline.

For further information on how to apply, see our  <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/prospective-pg">postgraduate web pages</a>.  The closing date for applications is March 1st 2012 and we will make  decisions on studentship allocation by May 1st 2012. (Applications after  March 1st may be considered, at our discretion.) Informal enquiries can  be directed to <a href="mailto:pg-admin-cs@st-andrews.ac.uk">pg-admin-cs@st-andrews.ac.uk</a> or to potential supervisors.</p></body></html>

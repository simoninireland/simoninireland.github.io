The <a href="http://www.aware-project.eu" target="_blank">Aware project</a> co-ordinates between a collection of EU projects into self-awareness and adaptive systems. As part of its remit it collects the evolving opinions of the research community to try to decide where the research is leading, and in particular what are the emerging questions that might be supported by future EU initiatives. Interviewing researchers is a new departure that I haven't seen before, and they <a href="http://www.aware-project.eu/category/research-agenda-2/video-opinions/" target="_blank">interviewed several people with diverse backgrounds</a> to get a broad sweep of the area.

I focused on how little we understand how to model what people actually do in the course of their lives, and consequently how hard it is to explain these processes to computers and build computer-mediated analysis and support.

<html><body><p>The Seventh International Workshop on Middleware Tools, Services and Run-time Support for Sensor Networks (<a href="http://www.midsens.org/" target="_blank">MidSensâ€™12</a>) will be co-located with <a href="http://middleware2012.cs.mcgill.ca/">Middleware 2012</a> (December 3rd - 7th, 2012) in Montreal, Canada

The aim of MidSens'12 is to stimulate research in the specific domain of middleware for sensor networks. The particular focus of MidSens'12 is the realization of <strong>multi-user, multi-purpose and federated sensing platforms</strong> that are capable of supporting next-generation application scenarios such as <strong>smart cities</strong>. Along with the core topic of middleware architectures, services and tool support, MidSens'12 will also seek papers describing novel programming languages, run-time support and relevant experience reports. MidSens'12 will investigate how middleware support can relieve developers from low-level, platform specific concerns, while enabling the optimal exploitation of heterogeneous resources to create <strong>sensing infrastructures of massive scale</strong>.

Effectively developing, deploying and managing sensor network platforms requires supporting middleware services, tools and run-time support. MidSens'12 welcomes papers on the following research topics:

<!--more-->

We currently offer two traditional Scottish four-year degrees, in Computer Science and Internet Computer Science. A number of factors have contributed to a desire to change this. We'd like to offer a straight-line programme from undergraduate to masters, more in line with European norms (the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process">Bologna process</a>"). For non-Scottish UK students (also known as "RUKs"), we'd like to offer direct entry into second year so that their more advanced A Level qualifications shorten their degree and reduce fee and accommodation costs accordingly. A straight-through programme will also let us present a more integrated collection of modules and improve our targeting for specialised degrees.

All this means we're introducing a five-year MSci degree in the next application cycle, for 2013 entry. Details are available <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/prospective-ug/degrees">here</a>.</p></body></html>

["Epidemic modelling: Some notes, maths, and
code"](https://simondobson.org/introduction-to-epidemics/), my book
about using network science to model epidemics, is now featured in the
gallery of the Executable Books project.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

[The Executable Books
Project](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/index.html) is a
project whose goal (according to their site) is "to build tools that
facilitate creating professional computational narratives (books,
lecture series, articles, etc.) using open source tools". In
particular they manage [Jupyter
Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), which is the tool I used to
write "Epidemic modelling".

The gallery can be found at:

[https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery.html](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery.html)

and has links to an impressive range of impressive texts, ranging from
introductions to data science to deeply technical descriptions of
scientific tools and methods. It's incredible that everything on
display is generated, and published, as open source.

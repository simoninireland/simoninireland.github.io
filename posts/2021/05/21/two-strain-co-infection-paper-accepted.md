After what feels like a *very* long time in review, our paper on
the dynamics of co-infection on clustered networks has been accepted
for publication.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

We submitted in [December](/blog/2020/12/18/coinfection-dynamics/),
and the paper's been back and to with the editors and reviews. But
happily it's now got through.

This is another example of how clustering in networks -- as is
typically found in social networks -- affects the way processes work
over them. The plot also shows a relationship between the sizes of
largest and second-largest connected components that we don't yet
understand, but might be important both for forecasting and (possibly)
countermeasures.

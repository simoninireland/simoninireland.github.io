Today I re-started work on my *other* book.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Several years ago I started writing a book, *Complex networks,
complex processes*, mainly as a way to guide my own study of the new
field I was starting to get into. It kind of fell by the wayside,
mainly because I was too busy but also because I couldn't get the
tools to work to my satisfaction. I wanted to be able to publish on
the web *and* in print, *and* to have the code executable by
readers. I tried to make it work myself and then lost motivation.

Last year, however, I discovered that the technology had moved on, and
I used it to write ["Epidemic modelling -- Some notes, maths, and
code"](/writing/em-book/). This has given me the impetus, so I've
restarted my earlier work -- well, actually, I've started largely
again from scratch so that I build-in what I've learned in the
succeeding years.

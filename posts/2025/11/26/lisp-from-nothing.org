  Nils Holm.  /Lisp from Nothing/. Lulu Press. 2025.

  This is a fascinating book that's very old-school -- and I mean
  that in the best possible way. It does exactly what it says:
  develops a Lisp interpreter (and then a compiler) from first
  principles, bootstrapped on top of an existing Lisp or Scheme
  against a runtime written in C, with all code provided.

  It's more than this, though. There's a thorough discussion of the
  differences between dynamic and lexical variable scope (and the
  implications for both programming and implementation). There's a
  digression into pure lambda calculus and the complexities that /it/
  introduces. There's a basic mark/sweep garbage collector. There's
  a brief history of Lisp and Lisp machines. And there's a
  performance evaluation that digs into where the costs lie within
  the system.

  Overall this is a book that every implementor should read, if only
  to see some other parts of the possible design space for Lisp
  tooling. Many applications will want to occupy a different point
  in that space, for example providing a richer compiler, or a
  richer runtime. But there's a lot to learn from the simplicity of
  the choices made here.

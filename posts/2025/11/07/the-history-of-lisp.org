* The history of Lisp

  Herbert Stoyan.  /[[https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/Stoyan-Geschichte.pdf][The History of Lisp]]/. 1980. Updated in the 1990s,
  translated into English 2023.

  Includes a history of the route from PLANNER to CONNIVER, in which
  the former was criticised for being a theorem prover when a
  programming language was needed -- an argument between two schools
  that's still going on today, as seen in the emergence of [[https://lean-lang.org/][Lean]].

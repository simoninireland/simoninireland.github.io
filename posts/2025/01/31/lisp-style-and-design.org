  Molly Miller and Eric Benson. /Lisp: Style and Design/. Digital Press.
  ISBN 978-0135384220. 1990.

  A book that would serve as a primer for someone tackling a
  significant piece of programming for the first time.

  The style is a bit stiff and occasionally slightly patronising,
  definitely positioned as being from senior to junior programmers.
  The depth of the material is variable: I found the treatment of
  macros quite superficial, not helped by the examples generating
  questionable code. It also places relatively little emphasis on
  CLOS and generic functions, which would get more space in a more
  modern treatment..

  The best chapters are those on debugging and (especially)
  performance engineering, which dig into the interactive tools
  generally available within Lisp and give a good end-to-end
  description of the use of ~declare~ forms to aid compiler
  optimisations.

  But again the book's age shows. It predates the obsessive
  relationship that many modern programmers have with unit testing
  and test automation, treating testing as an interactive activity
  alongside debugging rather than as a core and permanent part of
  program development and maintenance.

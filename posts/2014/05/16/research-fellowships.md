<strong>Research Fellowships in Autonomic Service-Oriented Computing for Smart Cities</strong>

Applications are invited for two Postdoctoral Research Fellowships at <a href="http://www.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/" target="_blank">Trinity College Dublin’s Distributed Systems Group</a> to investigate the provision of a new service-oriented computing infrastructure that provides demand-based composition of software services interacting with a city-wide, dynamic network infrastructure. The project will investigate autonomic adaptation of services and infrastructure, ensuring resilient service provision within an integrated, city-wide system.

Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a closely-related discipline and strong C++/C#/Java development skills. Experience with autonomic computing, service-oriented middleware, and/or smart city technologies is desirable as are strong mathematical skills.

The project is supported by Science Foundation Ireland under the Principal Investigator programme between 2014-2018 and will be conducted in collaboration with Cork Institute of Technology, NUI Maynooth, IBM Smarter Cities Research Centre, Intel Intelligent Cities Lab, EMC2 Research Europe, and Arup.  The position is tenable from September 2014.

Please apply by email to <a href="mailto:Siobhan.Clarke@scss.tcd.ie">Siobhan.Clarke@scss.tcd.ie</a> quoting “Smart Cities Fellowship” in the subject line. Applications should include a curriculum vitae, in PDF format, giving full details of qualifications and experience, together with the names of two referees. The closing date for applications is the 20th June, 2014.

Trinity College is an equal opportunities employer.

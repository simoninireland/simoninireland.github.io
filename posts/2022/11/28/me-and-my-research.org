  I've recently been thinking about my research directions, making use
  of some advice I came across years ago.

  {{{TEASER_END}}}

  My research interests seem to fluctuate over time, more than is the
  case for others who stay in one field. I started out as a
  high-performance computing guy, then worked on compilers,
  distributed and web systems pervasive computing, sensor networks,
  and data analytics -- and, most recently, complex networks and
  complex systems in general. This last work also seems to be
  involving a lot of high-performance computing, so I sometimes feel
  I'm coming full circle.

  One issue with evolving research interests is deciding /what/ to
  work on exactly. Interestingly, this is a question that fascinated
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming][Richard Hamming]], one of the founding fathers of information and
  coding theory, who in 1968 won the third-ever [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award][Turing award]] for his
  work on error-correcting codes.

  (Image from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming#/media/File:Richard_Hamming.jpg][Wikipedia]].) Even with this achievement, he remained
  fascinated by the mechanisms of deciding what to research to achieve
  the greatest possible impact. In a 1986 lecture "You and your
  research" cite:YouAndYourResearch he suggests that anyone thinking
  about what they want to work on should ask themselves two questions.

  The first is innocuous:

  - What is the most potentially transformative question in your
    field?

  But it's the second one that's the killer:

  - Is that what you work on?

  I think there are good reasons why the answers to these two
  questions might be different: you might not work somewhere that has
  access to the data you need, or the scale of resources, or funding.
  I suspect Hamming would disagree with me, and say that just means
  you need to find a new job.

  I first came across these questions about ten years ago, and they've
  stuck with me ever since: I often pass the lecture on to new
  researchers or academics. And I think it's a useful exercise to pose
  them to yourself periodically. So what are my answers now?

  You first need to identify your field. At the moment mine is complex
  systems, especially the computational and mathematical tooling
  needed to explore them.

  In network science there's a focus on the ways in which processes
  /finish/: their end states. A good example is the final size of an
  epidemic outbreak, which can (sometimes) be predicted from a few
  parameters and some information about the contact network's
  topology. But the current techniques say little or nothing about the
  /path the process takes/ to that end state, even though that's often
  of immense practical significance. Moreover they're often driven by
  only a coarse-grained understanding of the network, for example its
  mean degree, and ignore the fine structure on the assumption
  that this won't have much effect on the end state. That turns out
  to be wrong in a number of cases cite:ClusteredTwoPathogen-PRE21.

  So, what is the most potentially transformative question? For me I
  think it's this: *how does network local fine structure affect the
  paths of processes*? That is to say, if I introduce some structure
  that affects a part of a network -- a local decrease in edge
  density, for example, or a local increase in clustering -- what
  happens? There's a catalogue of such structures that appears in the
  literature such as clustering, layering, modularity, and so on: how
  can we understand their effects, /individually and together/, on the
  ways in which processes evolve?

  Why is this question potentially transformative? Because such
  structures, where there are local heterogeneities in network
  structure, are the /norm/ for real-world networks. Understanding how
  these variations affect processes therefore lets us analyse and
  simulate the processes in more realistic detail. But it also
  opens-up the possibility of leveraging such structures to affect
  how a process behaves, or even engineering them to obtain some
  desired effect.

  And this is what I intend to work on for the coming few years.

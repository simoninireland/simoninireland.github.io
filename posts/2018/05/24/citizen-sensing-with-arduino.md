Introducing some notes on low-power Arduino programming.

<!--more-->

In 2013 I did a summer project on using the <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> as a platform for "citizen sensing". This rapidly became an exploration of how to create hardware and software that can do sensing while operating in a very low-power regime, such as one would need for an environmental sensor.

There were several results from this project -- one of which <em>wasn't</em> an actual solution to the motivating problem I'd come up with. However, it did generate a lot of notes about low-power Arduino programming, both for hardware and software, and a software library that embodies some of them

I recently decommissioned the web site I was using to host this content, so I've ported it onto my main blog as a collection of <a href="/development/projects/citizen-sensing/">research and development notes</a>Â in case it's still of interest to anyone.

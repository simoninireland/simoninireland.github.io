		An engaging history of engineering through the the lens of ever-increasing precision. starting with more efficient steam engines and ending with spacecraft and microprocessors.<br /><br />Until about two-thirds of the way through I had a criticism that the book focused on precision solely as a means to mass production the need to components that are exactly the same to facilitate easy replacement, as contrasted against craft-made items. I was contrasting this against one-off, hand-made, but nonetheless precise artefacts such as the turbulence experiment described by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10401.James_Gleick" title="James Gleick" rel="nofollow noopener">James Gleick</a> in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64584.Chaos_Making_a_New_Science" title="Chaos Making a New Science by James Gleick" rel="nofollow noopener">Chaos: Making a New Science</a>: a tiny fluid chamber with embedded sensors, still regarded as one of the finest experiments ever crafted. But the discussions of watches more than remedied the omission.<br /><br />The chapter on Japan as a contrast to the "cult" of precision feels a bit forced. Yes, the Japanese have a sensitivity (<i>wabi sabi</i>) for the imperfect in art while maintaining a reverence for high-precision machines â€“ but so do other cultures and art forms, not least jazz and abstract impressionism, that render the contrast a bit superficial. <br /><br />

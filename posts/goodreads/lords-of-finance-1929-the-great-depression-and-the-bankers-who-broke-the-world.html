		A biography-led treatment of the Great Depression, differing substantially from the more traditional histories led by events.<br /><br />The biographies are indeed fascinating, both those of the four protagonists (central bankers in the US, Germany, France, and the UK), but also of some of the bit-players. Of the main characters, I was only previously aware of Hjalmar Schact, and then only of his involvement with the Nazis: his pivotal role in the Depression really sets the scene for his later mischief-making.<br /><br />I think it probably helps that the author is a former banker: he locks-in on the financially significant events whose importance might elude a less specialised historian. This wouldn't be my first choice as a financial history, but it certainly complements other better-known versions like JK Galbraith's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41591.The_Great_Crash_of_1929" title="The Great Crash of 1929 by John Kenneth Galbraith" rel="nofollow noopener">The Great Crash of 1929</a>.

    <p>
      What happens when the writer of <a href="http://xkcd.com" rel="nofollow noopener">xkcd</a> puts his mind to common everyday tasks? Hilarity, of course.... and as usual, a lot of fascinating physics.<br /><br />I would place this in the middle of Munroe's two books. It's far better, funnier, and grown-up that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25329850.Thing_Explainer_Complicated_Stuff_in_Simple_Words" title="Thing Explainer Complicated Stuff in Simple Words by Randall Munroe" rel="nofollow noopener">Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words</a>, but less fresh than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662.What_If__Serious_Scientific_Answers_to_Absurd_Hypothetical_Questions" title="What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe" rel="nofollow noopener">What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions</a>. For all that it's still laugh-out-loud funny, grounded in solid physics (albeit in absurd ways), and manages somehow to change the way you might actually look at problems in the future.

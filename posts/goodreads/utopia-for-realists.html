    <p>
      A paean to what's to come, to the need for radical changes in the economy and social norms in the face of a "utopia" of automation and globalisation. It's a provocation of the first order, strongly in favour of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income" rel="nofollow noopener">universal basic income</a>, strongly against nationalism and hard borders. As such it feels "utopian" in the classic sense of being an unrealisable dream â€“ but a closely-argued dream that highlights desirable changes, and well aware of the irony that the world we live in, with health and wealth and many jobs being automated, is <i>exactly</i> the world that most of human history aspired to.<br /><br />

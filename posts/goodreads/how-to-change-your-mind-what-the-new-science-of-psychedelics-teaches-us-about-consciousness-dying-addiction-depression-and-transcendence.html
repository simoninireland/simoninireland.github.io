      Almost enough to make one want to try them, this is a fine description of the history, biochemistry, and cultural significance of psychedelics. It walks a fine line between the materialistic and the spiritual: what do psychedelic trips signify, are they "just" drug experiences or do they connect with something else?<br /><br />It's a book that's worth reading for any of its component parts. The history sheds light both on the counterculture of the 60's and on the genesis and evolution of moral panics of the sort that resulted in LSD being proscribed. The biochemistry does its best to reflect the latest scientific thinking, but also shows how much of neuroscience is still tied up with speculative and metaphorical models of what's happening in the brain. And the personal history of the author's own trips – carefully supervised and with plenty of trepidation on his part – go some way to showing how influential and persistent the effects of the drugs can be.<br /><br />The book could do with some better copy-editing: it's repetitive in places. But well worth a read.

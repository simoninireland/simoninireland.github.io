		A fantastic narrative history, far broader in scope than might be expected from the sub-title, covering the extended campaigns in Spain and the Baltic as well as the familiar Latin Crusader States. That does make the coverage a little lighter, but Jones has covered much of the same ground form a different perspective in the (equally excellent) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34312336.The_Templars_The_Rise_and_Spectacular_Fall_of_God_s_Holy_Warriors" title="The Templars The Rise and Spectacular Fall of God's Holy Warriors by Dan Jones" rel="nofollow noopener">The Templars: The Rise and Spectacular Fall of God's Holy Warriors</a>.

		A study of meat-eating that's somewhat wider than the title might suggest. Indeed, very few mammals (although rather more fish) are actually killed by the author in the course of this book. There are several tours of slaughterhouses, a trawler voyage, some fish farming, and plenty of farm visits to see how the animals are kept and killed.<br /><br />This book is probably best seen as following in the general tradition of animal welfare, with extensive side journeys into climate change and the human population explosion. Its central message – eat less meat that's been better raised – is far more derived from these sources than from anything to do with killing the animals yourself.

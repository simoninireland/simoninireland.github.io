		An atmospheric and episodic tale of first contact. The descriptions are wonderful, and the focus on character is far more detailed than is common even in first-class science fiction. Lem leaves most of the plot elements unfinished, which is somewhat dissatisfying at one level but leaves plenty of space for the reader's imagination to play.

    <p>
      Post-apocalyptic fiction of a determinedly British kind. It's not a bad book, and has a certain complexity to it in exploring how people's attitudes might change when faced with the destruction of normal civilisation.<br /><br />A deadly virus destroys all grass-like plants, thereby eliminating almost all food crops and the cattle that they feed. Worried the government might atom-bomb the major population centres, a small group leave London to make their way to a Lake District valley. On the way they encounter looters, towns gone feral to protect themselves â€“ and become feral themselves, willing to kill to survive. In some ways it reads like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies" title="Lord of the Flies by William Golding" rel="nofollow noopener">Lord of the Flies</a> with adults and a more pervading sense of long-term doom.<br /><br />But it's also very much a novel of its time, full of racism, sexism, classism, deference, stiff upper lips, and a sense of self-justification wrapped-up as duty. That makes it a hard read, and it doesn't really have enough force to balance that out. Manu similar points are made elsewhere, for example in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93269.Earth_Abides" title="Earth Abides by George R. Stewart" rel="nofollow noopener">Earth Abides</a>, without the 1950s baggage.<br /><br />

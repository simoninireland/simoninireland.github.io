		I may be being a bit harsh on this book, which makes a decent attempt at filling in the social history of one of the greatest contributors to wartime victory: but it felt like it missed almost all the excitement and significance of Bletchley Park and failed to really dig into the characters of those involved, despite extensive interviews. At the very least it might motivate one to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150731.Alan_Turing_The_Enigma" title="Alan Turing The Enigma by Andrew Hodges" rel="nofollow noopener">Alan Turing: The Enigma</a> or one of the other histories or memoires that have come out in the past few years.

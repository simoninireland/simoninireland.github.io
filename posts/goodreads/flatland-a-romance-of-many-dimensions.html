		A satire of Victorian society, this little book also manages to be a pretty good introduction to abstract higher geometry. Written from the perspective of an inhabitant of a two-dimensional universe, it features social descriptions, dream sequences into one dimension, a subsequent venture into three dimensions, and the narrator's final coming to terms with his society's inability to believe his insights.<br /><br />The parallels with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7733.Gulliver_s_Travels" title="Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift" rel="nofollow noopener">Gulliver's Travels</a> are obvious, and Abbott is a better scientist and mathematician than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1831.Jonathan_Swift" title="Jonathan Swift" rel="nofollow noopener">Swift</a> but a less subtle satirist. Having said that, he manages to land some blows: the upper class aversion to "feeling" is probably my favourite, but his treatment of the women of Flatland and the need for (and impact of) wholesale social lying also bring a smile. <br />

    <p>
      The history and effect of Greece told through ten claimed characteristics of the Greek mind and civilisation. It's a strong claim and, while it makes for a reasonable read, doesn't quite pull off the effect that the author intended. It's hard say why, as the writing is clear and as erudite as one would expect from a classics professor at a leading university. Perhaps it's the lack of any clear <i>necessity</i> in choosing <i>these particular</i> traits, which leaves the whole assemblage feeling perhaps a little cherry-picked to make scholarly points.

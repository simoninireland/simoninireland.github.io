	A study of the dangers and absurdities of intelligence work, in which by definition it's hard to tell if information was made up or is just really, <i>really</i> hard to find.<br /><br />The book starts off quite slowly and only really gathers pace when the Wormold's inventions start to come out – at which point things get very interesting indeed. It's interesting to compare the slow and rather plodding protagonist to the racier Bond – or even <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/887797.Ashenden" title="Ashenden by W. Somerset Maugham" rel="nofollow noopener">Ashenden</a>, for that matter. Greene almost certainly captures reality more closely.

      <p>
	A how-to manual for passive resistance to a dictatorship. It's a believable presentation, perhaps a little <i>too</i> dry and deterministic in its suggestions about how to collapse a dictatorship's will to rule, but a book that feels amazingly and unfortunately relevant at the moment.

	  3/5.

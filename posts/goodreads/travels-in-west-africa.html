		A great insight into a period now long in the past. Mary Kingsley was clearly ahead of her time, not only in her independent travel but also in her perceptions of indigenous cultures in Africa and the coastal islands. But she was also distinctly <i>of</i> her time in the casual assumptions of sex and race that at times get rather wearing. The sensation is somewhat like reading a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8178475.Rider_Haggard" title="Rider Haggard" rel="nofollow noopener">Rider Haggard</a> novel: the same sense that the author means well and is impressed by the cultures being described while at the same time feeling they're both intrinsically inferior and unbridgeably different.

      The follow-up to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611819.The_Peripheral__Jackpot__1_" title="The Peripheral (Jackpot #1) by William Gibson" rel="nofollow noopener">The Peripheral</a>, where the plot gets weirder and the motives of everyone become more murky. I don't think it holds together as well as its predecessor, and there's none of the pace or surprise that made the earlier book so enjoyable. It might make good material for a further TV adaptation, though.

		A book full of anecdotes and charm, describing how a huge cast of characters have interacted with <i>La Serenissima</i> over the centuries. On the way, Gransard highlights the unique characteristics of Venice: its loose morals and easygoing charm, but also its mystery and romance, its associations with love and lust and death. Best read in conjunction with a visit, I think (as I read it), when one an follow in some character's footsteps to visit places perhaps not highlighted in the modern guidebooks.

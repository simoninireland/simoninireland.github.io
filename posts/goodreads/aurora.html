	It's unusual to find a negative take on the idea of generation starships. Most authors like the idea; Robinson isn't one of them, and indeed makes a strong argument that the whole notion of planetary colonisation is flawed. It's argued so well that's it's hard to refute.<br /><br />The book is excellently written as well as being closely argued: good characters and social interactions, and a sensible and believable plot. My only criticism would be that it's one chapter too long: the final beach scene doesn't add anything, in my opinion, and I'm hard-pushed to understand why it's there at all.

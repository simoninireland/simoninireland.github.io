    <p>
      A re-telling of some of the core Norse legends by a master of science fiction. Gaiman's drawn heavily on Norse mythology in his "Sandman" series, especially in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25101.Season_of_Mists__The_Sandman___4_" title="Season of Mists (The Sandman, #4) by Neil Gaiman" rel="nofollow noopener">Season of Mists</a>. But he does a fantastic job of rendering the stories in prose too, with a carefully chosen selection and a voice that's perfectly pitched: not trying to be modern, but not being self-consciously archaic or imitative either. In many ways the only shame is that it's too little taken from such a large body of possible tales.

	5/5.

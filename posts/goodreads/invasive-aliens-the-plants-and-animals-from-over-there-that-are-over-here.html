		The story of plants and animals invading the UK, mainly (though not entirely) with human intervention. Full of anecdotes and strange twists as species interact.<br /><br />It's hard to say whether the overall impact of invasive species is positive or negative. It's remarkable that many species that invade other countries do <i>better</i> there than they did at home, which is a positive for global biodiversity in a sense. I also hadn't realised how deliberate a lot of introductions were, and how two-way they went between Europe and the "New World".

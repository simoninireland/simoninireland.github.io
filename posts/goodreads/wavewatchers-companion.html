		I wanted to like this book, but it's actually a bit disappointing. I think perhaps that's because it tries too hard. There's a lot of fascinating information about waves in here, and an accessible overview of the physics of the various phenomena. But there's also a lot of stretching to make things waves that really aren't, and certainly aren't in the same category of being watched as ocean waves. A more focused book might have achieved the author's aims more effectively.

    <p>
      Better thought of as a sequence of related short stories rather than a novel, and more <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36260.Leslie_Charteris" title="Leslie Charteris" rel="nofollow noopener">Leslie Charteris</a> than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2565.Ian_Fleming" title="Ian Fleming" rel="nofollow noopener">Ian Fleming</a>. If you can get past the casual racism (completely normal for the time) then it's an interesting take on the life of an intelligence operative.

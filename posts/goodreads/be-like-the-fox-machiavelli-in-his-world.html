		A different interpretation of Machiavelli than the common one, viewing him as a republican rather than as a supporter and facilitator of tyrants. It's an attractive and quite compelling thesis, and surprisingly (to me, anyway) one that was common amongst early readers of <i>The prince</i> before his reputation changed in later centuries.

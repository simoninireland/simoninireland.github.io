	Sub-titled as being by the man who predicted the pandemic. He didn't, of course, he predicted <i>a</i> pandemic – which he expected to be of influenza, not coronavirus, which was relegated to a "regional" risk.<br /><br />That's not a criticism of this book, however, which is a powerful exploration of the world's state of preparedness for pandemics and – more importantly – some very detailed policy prescriptions to improve that level that are now even more relevant given what we know about pandemic spread in the modern world.<br /><br />The style is a mixture between personal anecdotes and broader perspectives: very characteristic of Mark Olshaker, whose style I think I could have recognised (from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126584.Mindhunter_Inside_the_FBI_s_Elite_Serial_Crime_Unit" title="Mindhunter Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit by John E. Douglas" rel="nofollow noopener">Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94340.The_Cases_That_Haunt_Us" title="The Cases That Haunt Us by John E. Douglas" rel="nofollow noopener">The Cases That Haunt Us</a>, which is co-write with John Douglas) even had I not seen his name on the cover. It gives an immediacy to the content that otherwise risks becoming lost in a maze of science and politics.

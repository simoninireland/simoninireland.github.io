	Another romp through the idea of computational demonology. It avoids the cliche of the spy novel by ... making the notion of being a cliche into a plot device. As a homage to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9494.H_P__Lovecraft" title="H.P. Lovecraft" rel="nofollow noopener">H.P. Lovecraft</a> this entire series is hard to beat, full of knowing allusions handled deftly and with a touch of cyberpunk.

	  5/5.
	    Finished 30 May 2020.

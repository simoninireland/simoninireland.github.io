		many fabulous anecdotes to a life spent in travel reportage, accompanies and complemented by the <i>Travels</i> of Herodotus. The conjunction doesn't sit quite comfortably for me: not enough Herodotus, and perhaps not sufficiently entangled into the autobiography, but still left me wanting to read the classic.

    <p>
      A study of the effects of education as both liberating and disconnecting.<br /><br />The family that the author describes is both harrowingly dysfunctional and strangely close-knit, which goes a long way to explaining how hard she found to draw herself away from it. She followed a charmed academic trajectory that many academics would kill for – Brigham Young University, then a scholarship and PhD from Cambridge, then a fellowship at Harvard – and I think it's a fair question as to whether she'd've been able to break away had she had a <i>less</i> exceptional start.<br /><br />The overriding themes are easy to see, revolving around a desire (indeed, a need) for male relatives to control female behaviour. There are plenty of echoes of works like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156.Hillbilly_Elegy_A_Memoir_of_a_Family_and_Culture_in_Crisis" title="Hillbilly Elegy A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by J.D. Vance" rel="nofollow noopener">Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis</a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156.Hillbilly_Elegy_A_Memoir_of_a_Family_and_Culture_in_Crisis" title="Hillbilly Elegy A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by J.D. Vance" rel="nofollow noopener">Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis</a>, but one thing that's distinctive about Westover's experience is that the fundamentalist position that her family adopts doesn't go far back: even her grandparents disagree with it, and it seems to be as much a product of her father's mental illness and mother's subservience as anything inherent in a strongly religious tradition. It's definitely one of the most challenging personal backgrounds I know of to have been successfully overcome.

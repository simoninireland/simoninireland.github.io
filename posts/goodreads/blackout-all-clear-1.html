		While I enjoyed the descriptions of the scenes in this book, and its invocation of an Oxford in forty years' time that's almost identical to the present, I found it quite slow and lacking in resolution. I realise (now) that it's the first in a series, but it leaves far too much hanging to work as a stand-alone novel (as many series manage to do).

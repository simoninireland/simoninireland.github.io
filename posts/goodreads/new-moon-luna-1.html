      What would living on the moon be like? How would the inhabitants relate to those left on earth? What would be the economics? The sociology?<br /><br />There's more than a touch of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19048107.Robert_Heinlein" title="Robert Heinlein" rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Heinlein</a>'s masterpiece <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16690.The_Moon_is_a_Harsh_Mistress" title="The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein" rel="nofollow noopener">The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a> here, updated for the twenty-first century. McDonald has the moon evolving an clan-based oligarchy that resembles fourteenth century Italy, but with some amazingly clever nods to the science and engineering needed to actually build a viable lunar civilisation, as well as for their social implications.

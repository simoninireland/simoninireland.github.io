      Â£5 well spent in a charity shop. This is a collection of essays on different historical mysteries. There's something for everyone: the building of Stonehenge, the abandonment of the <i>Mary Celeste</i>, and (my personal favourite) the fate of the Princes in the Tower. Perhaps a book best dipped into.<br /><br />Some of the essays haven't aged well against subsequent scholarship. That's inevitable and doesn't detract from them as decent introductions to a wide range of happenings.

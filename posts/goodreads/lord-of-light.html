    <p>
      Often regarded as Zelazny's masterpiece, and it's easy to see why (although personally I prefer <i>Amber</i>, of which there are echoes here). A complex tale told somewhat non-linearly, and there are more echoes from the "real" history of the Hindu pantheon that is being re-enacted (or maybe acted for the first time?) on a world colonised from Earth.

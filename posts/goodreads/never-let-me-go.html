		This is a very accessible piece of literary fiction that describes the experiences of a group of adults growing up in a near-future distopia -- I won't say why it's distopian as this comes out gradually over time. There are clear parallels with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World" title="Brave New World by Aldous Huxley" rel="nofollow noopener">Brave New World</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale" title="The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood" rel="nofollow noopener">The Handmaid's Tale</a>: the closest parallel I know of the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/" rel="nofollow noopener">The Beach</a>, which would offer a more direct and less literary approach.

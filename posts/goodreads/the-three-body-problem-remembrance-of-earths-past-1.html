		Quite an astonishing book, combining science fiction with social commentary and Chinese history in a seamless and rather stunning way.<br /><br />This book has some really quite visionary passages, drawing deeply on cultural history and the farther reaches of mathematical physics. It also has some resonances from the SF classics, especially (and perhaps surprisingly) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21611.The_Forever_War__The_Forever_War___1_" title="The Forever War (The Forever War, #1) by Joe Haldeman" rel="nofollow noopener">The Forever War</a>, with its central problem of how to fight a war in the face of travel times long enough to render your weaponry obsolete? Liu's solution is brilliant: find a way to stall your enemy's scientific progress, using both scientific and social weapons, with the latter also having eerie resonances in modern social-media commentaries. An excellent and thought-provoking start to a trilogy.

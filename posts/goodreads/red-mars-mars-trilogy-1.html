      <p>
	A future history of colonising another planet. It was written in the 1990s but reads like it was written in the late 2010s: a penetrating exploration of how nationalism, capitalism, and a desire for independence might play out over interplanetary distances, all told with Robinson's usual hardest-of-the-hard-science approach.

	  4/5.
	    Finished 22 November 2021.

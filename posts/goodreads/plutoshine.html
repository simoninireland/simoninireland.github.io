    <p>
      It's incredible to read a science fiction book that's so informed by something as recent as the "New Horizons" mission to Pluto: a book that couldn't have been written, or whose several key plot elements would have been different, if written fives years earlier. This is a political take on terraforming, focusing on the fact that all major movements are always problematic and opposed s they get started; but it's also about capitalism, family dynamics, and the search for scientific fame that the author has (I imagine) experienced first-hand.

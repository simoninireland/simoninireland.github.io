      Not so much a book to read as one to sink into, preferably with a map beside you to help plan trips. The diversity of islands around Scotland is quite breathtaking, both in terms of their sizes and inhabitants, but also in terms of their ownerships (who knew Buddhist monks favoured islands in the Clyde?).<br /><br />It's hard to read this book without being reminded of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15256001.DH_Lawrence" title="DH Lawrence" rel="nofollow noopener">DH Lawrence</a>'s short story "The man who loved islands". Anyone who loves them won't be disappointed.

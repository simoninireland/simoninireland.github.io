		An enjoyable and fascinating collection of grotesqueries, somewhat marred by the self-consciousness of some of the language. There are some wonderful anecdotes and a lot of kind insight into the human condition, especially as experienced by those with unusual neurological function, whether "natural" or caused by brain damage. But some of the language used is simply annoying ("egurgitations"? "vociferating"? – really?), and Sacks falls into something a trap in not being able to decide whether to use – or not use – the medical terminology, with the result that one neither sees enough to make it familiar nor avoids enough to hear about the conditions in commonplace terms.

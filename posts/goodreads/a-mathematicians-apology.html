    <p>
      A short dispatch from another world. It's hard to recognise the academia portrayed by Hardy, and I'm not sure that's a bad thing. One has to admire its purity, though: a principled neglect of everything outside a particular field of study, and the deeply interwoven social life that goes with it. It sounds at once attractive and claustrophobic, inspiring and shallow.<br /><br />Hardy is a perfect narrator and exemplar, being so diffident about his own accomplishments as to characterise them as having worked with one excellent mathematician (Littlewood) and discovered another (Ramanujan). He was a lot more than that within the small world of number theory in which he worked, including being a foundational contributor to computational complexity theory (although not in the exact definition currently used).<br /><br />Reading this book sometimes feels like an intellectual making a trip to the world of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58045504.Brideshead_Revisited_The_Sacred_and_Profane_Memories_of_Captain_Charles_Ryder" title="Brideshead Revisited The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder by Evelyn Waugh" rel="nofollow noopener">Brideshead Revisited</a>, and that may be the right way to think of academia in the inter-war years: tied-up in upper-class privilege, class-consciousness, and repression.

		An essay masquerading as a book.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed it. It's just that the point it's making â€“ that the way we project ourselves involves a mixture of strength and warmth, which are two concepts that sit uneasily together and make it hard to make the impressions we seek to make &amp;dash; could have been stated in a longform essay rather than a book. Instead we're treated to the same concepts applied to different personal-development challenges in ways that don't really seem to contribute anything to the message.

		An eclectic collection of detective fiction largely contemporary with Holmes' exploits. It's a mixed bag, featuring both well-known and now-forgotten authors, and it's easy to see the selection process at work: the stories of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/843679.William_Le_Queux" title="William Le Queux" rel="nofollow noopener">William Le Queux</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15595974.Baroness_Emma_Orczy" title="Baroness Emma Orczy" rel="nofollow noopener">Baroness Orczy</a> stand out (in completely different ways) for their skilled construction.

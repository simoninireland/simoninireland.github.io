      "Brief" they are indeed: this is not Feynman's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5553.Six_Easy_Pieces_Essentials_of_Physics_By_Its_Most_Brilliant_Teacher" title="Six Easy Pieces Essentials of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher by Richard Feynman" rel="nofollow noopener">Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher</a> in any respect, rather it's a popular-science description of some of the currents in modern physics. And it's amazingly well-done, making the concepts understandable as only someone immersed in them and gifted both in the science and in literature can possibly make them.

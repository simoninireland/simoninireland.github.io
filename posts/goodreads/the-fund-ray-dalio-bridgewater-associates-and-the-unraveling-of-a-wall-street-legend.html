      Ray Dalio has always been a somewhat divisive figure in finance. He's been a remarkably successful fund manager who rose from nothing to head an enormously powerful and innovative group.<br /><br />But like many successful businessmen, Dalio seemed unable to rest on that success. He developed "the rules" as a template for his success, and within Bridgewater insisted that they form part of everyone's mindset. He supplemented this with public shamings of a style that can only be likened to the "struggle sessions" of the Cultiral Revolution, with the target being required to confess their wrongdoings and promise improvement â€“ often as a direct precursor to being demoted or fired. But of course the "rules" were infinitely malleable to match Dalio's own needs of the moment, making them a tool of control rather than any kind of proper guide to conduct.<br /><br />A lot of this was public knowledge, but forgiven by investors and collaborator because of the returns that Bridgewater generated. That's a recurring theme in finance, for example as recounted in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7740121.No_One_Would_Listen" title="No One Would Listen by Harry Markopolos" rel="nofollow noopener">No One Would Listen</a>, and encourages a culture of impunity when accompanied by profits.

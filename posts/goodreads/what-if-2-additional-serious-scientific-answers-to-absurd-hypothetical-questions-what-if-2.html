    <p>
      A <i>tour de force</i> of creative scientific answers. It's perhaps less enjoyable than the original <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662.What_If__Serious_Scientific_Answers_to_Absurd_Hypothetical_Questions__What_If____1_" title="What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions (What If?, #1) by Randall Munroe" rel="nofollow noopener">What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions</a> â€“ but only because it <i>is</i> a sequel, and so lacks the novelty of the first. It's still a rush, ranging from cosmology down to particle physics, with enough black holes to satisfy anyone. And I also learned about the <a href="https://mybestplace.com/en/article/ussuri-bay-the-most-beautiful-glass-beach-in-the-world" rel="nofollow noopener">Glass beach of Vladivostok</a>, which is a place I'd never imagined existed and made the book worthwhile all on its own, just as Randall said it would.

      I've wanted to read a biography of Mussolini for a while, and this one is very good. A reviewer quote on the cover describes it as "lucid, elegant, and a pleasure to read," and I'd have to agree. It's somewhat more "literary" than some biographies, and as a result doesn't always cover the historical context as well as one might like: the author's description of the March on Rome, for example, is extremely brief despite it's significance for Mussolini's rise. In this way it's not like many Hitler biographies (for example <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/355434.Hitler" title="Hitler by Joachim Fest" rel="nofollow noopener">Hitler</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/782319.Hitler_and_Stalin_Parallel_Lives" title="Hitler and Stalin Parallel Lives by Alan Bullock" rel="nofollow noopener">Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives</a>) which are as much about events as personality. One also has to get past the author's repetition of words like "euphonious" and "lucubrations", which get tiresome after a while. Having said all that, this is an excellent biography, full of insight and pointers to other sources (with over 80 pages of footnotes), and is a good overview to the career of someone often written off too quickly.

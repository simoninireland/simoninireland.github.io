    <p>
      Definitely a book in the recognisible style of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6088007.Neuromancer__Sprawl___1_" title="Neuromancer (Sprawl, #1) by William Gibson" rel="nofollow noopener">Neuromancer</a>, based on a complicated premise of multiple worlds and semi-shared histories. It's possible for the inhabitants of one world (which may or may not be the "original") to visit the parallel versions at different points in their histories, and <i>vice versa</i>, but not in such a way as to affect their own history: a neat way to avoid paradoxes.<br /><br />I came to this book after watching the TV adaptation â€“ which I have to say I think is better, although it strips-away some of the philosophical explanations in pursuit of a more rapid plot.

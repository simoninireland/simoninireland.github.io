    <p>
      A meditation is exactly what this book is: a wandering, thoughtful, and ultimately open-ended examination of aging and what it means to age well. The author is a knowledgeable philosopher, well able to explain the thoughts of a dazzling range of thinkers. In the end – and to the extent that the book <i>has</i> a conclusion – he seems to arrive at a measure of Zen mindfulness: a valuable old age is best achieved by <i>being</i> the old man, by exploring what the state has to offer, and not wanting it to be other than it is.

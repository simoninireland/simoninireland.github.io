		This is the book on which the film "Downfall"was largely based, and is I think the only treatment of these events by a German author. Fest exposes a lot of the research and interpretation that's happened since the other, classic histories were written, and gives a very insightful analysis of how the bunker doors into the context of Hitler's life and the end of the Third Reich. Well worth a read

		Complicated stuff explained in simple words.<br /><br />It's hard to decide how to classify <i>Thing explainer</i>. On the one hand it should be a children's book: I once owned a book called "What makes it go?" that did a similar job. And Monroe does an excellent job at explaining things that children will <i>want</i> to know about: the US space team's up-goer five, Earth's past, the Big thing tiny hitter, and more. And also some things they hopefully <i>won't</i> want to know too much about, like the Machine for burning cities.<br /><br />But there's also something of a conceit to the book, in that it's limiting its vocabulary for effect and not simply for clarity of explanation. That makes some things a <i>lot</i> harder than they need to be, and marks the book out as really not for children at all.<br /><br />That being said, it's extremely enjoyable, as well-written and well-illustrated as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662.What_If__Serious_Scientific_Answers_to_Absurd_Hypothetical_Questions" title="What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe" rel="nofollow noopener">What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions</a> and the rest of <a href="http://www.xkcd.org" rel="nofollow noopener">xkcd</a>. Definitely to be recommended.

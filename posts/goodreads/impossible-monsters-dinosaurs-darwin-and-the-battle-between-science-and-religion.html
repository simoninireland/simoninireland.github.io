      How dinosaurs drove the development of the theory of evolution – and a lot more.<br /><br />It's hard to credit that the first dinosaurs were only discovered at the end of the 18th century. They emerged into a world that had little doubt about the literal truth of biblical creation. They helped to shatter that certainty, although not alone and not at once.<br /><br />This is a book that itself shatters several myths. It shows how Victorian scientists were as religious as their fellow citizens – and often more so – and how their faith coloured their interpretations of the evidence they themselves were discovering. It describes a Darwin too afraid of the possible social consequences ot publish his theories of natural selection as they are formed, and indeed he doesn't publish them until he's slowly built up his reputation as a naturalist through more traditional means: a level of patience that would be unthinkable today. And it shows that his interactions with Alfred Russel Wallace – often described as his rival – were marked by kindness and high regard on both sides, with Wallace modestly content in taking a supporting role (and later being a pallbearer at Darwin's interrment in Westminster Abbey).<br /><br />Over the source of the 19th century the religious certainties are challenged successfully, but there was nothing inevitable about the triumph and the opponents absolutely did not go quietly. Atheism remained the last taboo: long after Catholics and non-confirmist Protestants had their civil and political rights restored, atheists still had to fight to be allowed to take seats in Parliament. Taylor presents this as part of the conflict driven by the dinosaurs and the scientific changes their discovery drove, and it's hard to argue with him.<br /><br />There are some fascinating vignettes. My favourite is when Alfred Russel Wallace takes a bet to show the earth is not flat, and devises an ingenious method that of course doesn't rely on any modern technology or arguments, but which is self-evidently correct. That there are still many flat-earthers even today is testament to the abiding need to keep pressing for science and evidence in public life.

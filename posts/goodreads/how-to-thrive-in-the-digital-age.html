    <p>
      A short exploration of the state of modern internet and social experience. In some ways the book is mis-named, in that it isn't in any way prescriptive or suggestive of <i>how</i> one should thrive, but rather illustrates some of the issues one should consider in order to: such issues as privacy, time away, imaginary <i>vs</i> real experience, and the like. Definitely worth a read, and with an excellent bibliography pointing to further information.

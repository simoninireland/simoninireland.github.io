	Philip Roth

    <p>
      A carefully-constructed counterfactual of a fictional Lindbergh presidency and of America's descent into fascism â€“ before being saved from itself by the entreaties of a revered and bereaved widow. It's clever and evocatively written from the perspective of a 9-year-old surrogate of Roth himself, and so convincing that the author feels the need to include a summary of the real historical figures he mentions as an appendix.<br /><br />Reading this book in 2023 brings out some echoes that perhaps wouldn't have been apparent on an earlier reading. There's a lot of consideration of fake news, of misinformation and questionable government initiatives, and even of a "Big Lie" that populists and fabulists can lock onto. And it's shocking that some the anti-Semitism that existed before and during the war still exists today, in an increasingly-less-camouflaged form.

	An excellent tour through the Renaissance that doesn't steer away from the bits that don;t fit the usual narrative. Whether I'd agree with the subtitle of "alternative" history I'm less certain: it certainly mentions the role of women and the prevalence of slavery more than other books, and also explores the relationship between Italians and Spaniards in the conquest of the New World in interesting ways, though.

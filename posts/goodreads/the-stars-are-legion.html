	Space opera in a very different form. For a start, there are literally no men in the cast (universe). Secondly, the location and context of the story – giant world-sized spaceships closely orbiting a star and fighting amongst themselves – isn't explained or in any way inferable. Reality never becomes clear, but that works really well to set this story apart and let the author's quite astounding imagination run free without constraints.

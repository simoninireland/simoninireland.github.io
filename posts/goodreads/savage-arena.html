Still one of the greatest mountaineering books ever written, all the
more poignant for being posthumous. It's the book that first fired my
imagination for the mountains.
<p>
The climbs that Tasker tackles (with a variety of "great names" from
British muntaineering of the era) gradually grow in severity â€“
although starting with the north face of the Eiger is hardly a normal
progression! His honesty in describing his feelings is remarkable, not
least because they're generally feelings of technical and emotional
inadequacy. These are set amid quite epic descriptions of climbing
challenges and the (often grim) reality of being on expeditions in the
Himalayas.
<p>
Tasker often compares his own emotional state to that of his
companions, notably the notoriously self-contained Dick Renshaw and
equally notoriously voluble Doug Scott. It's hard to know from this
book what they would have thought of him: he gives the impression of
being rather inscrutable himself (an impression that Chris Bonnington
reinforces in his forward). It's perhaps a trait that served him well
on the walls when the going got especially tough, as it did
frequently. He finds himself repeatedly questioning his motivations
for climbing without reaching too much of a conclusion. He seems
simply to accept it: it's what he does, there doesn't have to be a
reason, and the dangers and isolation are simply part of the cost. It
never feels over-examined.

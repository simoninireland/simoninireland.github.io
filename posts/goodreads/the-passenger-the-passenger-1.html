	Cormac McCarthy

    <p>
      A book with wonderful writing by somehow missing something.<br /><br />And the writing really is superb. McCarthy can build a scene out of almost no words, even somewhere as unfamiliar as a New Orleans flophouse or a powerboat traversing the Caribbean. He can also build credible character backstories for those with even the least credible histories without it ever feeling contrived.<br /><br />But... The book is premised on a mystery, the finding by divers of a plane crashed at sea that's clearly been visited before they get there, with something of value having been removed. What was it? Why was it valuable? Why are there federal investigators chasing it? – and why do so many of the people involved wind up inexplicably dead? That's a fascinating set-up, and so it's deeply disapointing that it remains exactly that: a set-up, unexplained and unresolved. It's not that there's a lack of plot, it's simply that it leads nowhere, and that's a wasted opportunity for so gifted a writer.

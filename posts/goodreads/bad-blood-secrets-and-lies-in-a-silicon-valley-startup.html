	A history of the Theranos blood-testing scandal.<br /><br />Theranos was once the hottest Silicon Valley property. There seem to have been several reasons for this, one of which was <i>not</i> its technology, which was largely undemonstrated and unproven â€“ and which turned out to be entirely fictitious (or "vapourware", in software terms). But it had a charismatic CEO who self-consciously fashioned herself on Steve Jobs, and an origin story phrased in terms of "disrupting" an existing industry that was worth billions. That, it seems, was enough.<br /><br />This is really a story of how a weird corporate culture managed to silence its critics within and without. Those within often <i>knew</i> something was wrong, especially those with experience in other start-ups. Those without were either threatened or bought off. But it's shocking to what extent many senior people seemed quite content to represent, advise, and profit from a company while being contentedly ignorant of what its product actually <i>was</i>.<br /><br />The executives in charge have faced the courts, and their defence seemed largely to be that "fake it 'till you make it" was a valid new-economy strategy. I have some sympathy with the idea, and they certainly weren't the first group to try it. Where they <i>were</i> perhaps more innovative was in trying this with a healthcare device, probably the most regulated business niche and not a place to attempt a fraud. Perhaps their enthusiasm ran away with them, but there's plenty in this book that illuminates shady practices and ruthlessness that don't make them look at all sypathetic.

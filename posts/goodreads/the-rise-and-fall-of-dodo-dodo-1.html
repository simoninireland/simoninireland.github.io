	Magic is dead â€“ or is it just postponed? If a secret US military agency has its way, witches will be re-empowered (within closely controlled limits) and able to influence the past (again, within limits) in advantageous ways, But the witches have other ideas....<br /><br />It's the limits that make this book interesting. They've been carefully crafted to structurally avoid the contrivances that often plague time-travel novels. It also takes aim at the dangers and blindness <br />of a bureaucracy trying to control something that its fundamentally doesn't understand.<br /><br />This is something of a return to form (in my opinion) for Stephenson after <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024.Anathem" title="Anathem by Neal Stephenson" rel="nofollow noopener">Anathem</a> and (especially) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10552338.Reamde" title="Reamde by Neal Stephenson" rel="nofollow noopener">Reamde</a>: back to the style of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883.Snow_Crash" title="Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson" rel="nofollow noopener">Snow Crash</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827.The_Diamond_Age_Or__a_Young_Lady_s_Illustrated_Primer" title="The Diamond Age Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer by Neal Stephenson" rel="nofollow noopener">The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer</a>. Although having said that it's a book that's clearly a scene-setter for a sequel rather than in any way self-contained.

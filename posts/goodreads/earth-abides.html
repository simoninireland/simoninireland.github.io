		One of the earliest examples of post-apocalyptic science fiction. It's awash with ideas and thoughtful analysis of the challenges that might face a remnant of humanity living in the wreckage of a disaster â€“ even one that, in this case, didn't involve a war.<br /><br />It's not a book that's aged well, though. Stewart isn't a natural fiction writer, and his characters never become anything more than two-dimensional stereotypes both in terms of their reactions and their relationships. In that sense it's inferior to, for example, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164154.A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz__St__Leibowitz___1_" title="A Canticle for Leibowitz (St. Leibowitz, #1) by Walter M. Miller Jr." rel="nofollow noopener">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239919.Damnation_Alley" title="Damnation Alley by Roger Zelazny" rel="nofollow noopener">Damnation Alley</a>, but enjoyable nonetheless.

	The classic expos√© of advertising. In many ways this book remains fresh, perhaps because of the popularity of <i>Mad Men</i> in bringing 50's advertising culture back to prominence. In others, it hasn't aged well and is clearly a product of its time. If you can get back the casual sexism and references to tobacco's "cancer scare", however, it's still a great read.<br /><br />I found it impossible to read this book without thinking of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2527900.Nudge_Improving_Decisions_About_Health__Wealth__and_Happiness" title="Nudge Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness by Richard H. Thaler" rel="nofollow noopener">Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</a>, another exploration of how to affect people's behaviour "for their own good". It's hard to decide which is more insidious. While advertising has undoubtedly had long-term effects on our behaviour in the half-century since Packard wrote, it's also true that many of the techniques being espoused are now so obvious that they've ceased to be effective: I sometimes wonder whether advertising now almost <i>has</i> to be ironic just to get past people's media filters. As a thoughtful introduction from a time just starting to show the complexities of the modern world, though, this book is hard to beat.

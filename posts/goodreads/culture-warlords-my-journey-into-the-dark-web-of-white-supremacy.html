      <p>
	Very much a dive into the murk of internet conspiracies and racism: an important book that shines a welcome (if that's the right word) light on how the internet perpetuates and accelerates extremism, and especially how the tropes of past outbreaks (mainly against Jews) re-appear in updated guises time after time.<br /><br />I think the book would be stronger if it focused more on Lavin's actual experiences in the various fora she explores. Some of the other chapters, while interesting, aren't really about her own journey and so slightly weaken the first-person narrative.

	  4/5.

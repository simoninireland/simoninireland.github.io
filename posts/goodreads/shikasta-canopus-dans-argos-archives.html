    <p>
      Why is modern civilisation so self-destructive and complicated? The answer from this alternative history is that a previously time of happiness and long lives was subverted by a change in the universal forces to induce the current malaise.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book, but it does live up to its sub-title: <i>Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days</i>. It's told in a very disjointed form using purported reports and other documents, much of the time from the diary of a young girl who doesn't really know what's going on, and so can't really advance the plot very effectively. That makes it hard work, even though the writing and the overall premise are excellent.

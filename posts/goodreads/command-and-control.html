	History at its most nail-biting. This should be read as a counterpoint to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248513.Plutopia_Nuclear_Families__Atomic_Cities__and_the_Great_Soviet_and_American_Plutonium_Disasters" title="Plutopia Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters by Kate Brown" rel="nofollow noopener">Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters</a>, a description of the military plans that led to the need for the nuclear materials.<br /><br />Many of the anecdotes are terrifying, and make one wonder how we managed to to survive the Cold War â€“ and how we'll survive the current era too, given that the systems are all still in place with their existing faults.

	This book tells part of the amazing story of an amazing man, who came back from serious injury to first climb all the Scottish Munros in a single winter season. It's a stunning accomplishment by any measure, and set Moran up for a future as a mountaineering guide before his tragic death.<br /><br />I'm sorry that it's not a better book. The prose is quite wooden, lacking all the flourish and power that one finds in, for example, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19294505.Savage_Arena" title="Savage Arena by Joe Tasker" rel="nofollow noopener">Savage Arena</a>. As just one example amongst many:<br /><br /><i>"Only with sadness did we leave the lovely Etive, thinking with regret of those roads and glens of Argyll that our journey would not traverse again."</i><br /><br />It's a shame that the writing doesn't live up either to the country being described or the challenge being successfully attempted.

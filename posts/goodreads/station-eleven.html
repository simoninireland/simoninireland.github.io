      <p>
	A well-crafted post-apocalyptic tale of how civilisation would collapse promptly in the face of a major epidemic. This is very much in the path of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164154.A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz" title="A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M. Miller Jr." rel="nofollow noopener">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a>, albeit set in the immediate rather than far future. There are also shades of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16598849.Robert_Heinlein" title="Robert Heinlein" rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Heinlein</a>'s novella "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_This_Goes_On%E2%80%94&quot;" rel="nofollow noopener">"If this goes on</a>" as religion re-emerges in a particularly malign form.<br /><br />The best scene, in my opinion, is the almost banal account of how a group of people behave when stranded in a rural airport, dealing with the sudden realisation that civilisation isn't coming back, help isn't coming, and they'll have to fend for themselves.

	What would happen to society if the the internet died? That's premise of this book, and it comes to w weirdly similar technical conclusion to that in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55134785.How_to_Destroy_Surveillance_Capitalism_" title="How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism. by Cory Doctorow" rel="nofollow noopener">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism.</a>: replace it with a decentralised network that's inherently privacy-preserving.<br /><br />Of course there's a lot more to it than that, and it's a well-drawn story of what a social collapse might look like when "just" to communications infrastructure collapses, leaving everything else intact â€“ but useless because it's all been optimised to algorithmic control and can't meaningfully function without it.

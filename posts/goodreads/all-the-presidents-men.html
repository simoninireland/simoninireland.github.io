		A story of dedicated reporting in the face of both active and passive discouragement. This book is interesting because it, again, it written before the end of the story is known: before Nixon's resignation and all the subsequent fallout.<br /><br />Being written so in the moment, there's an assumption that the reader lived through and followed the events being described: Woodward and Bernstein don't seem to be writing for posterity. As such the book makes little sense <i>unless</i> the reader has at least a passing – and actually more than a passing – acquaintance with the events and characters. That can make it hard to keep up with.

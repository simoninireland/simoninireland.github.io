	<blockquote><br />I rhyme<br />To see myself, to set the darkness echoing.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Heaney's first volume of poems all relate to his growing-up in the country. Lots of the allusions are to an Ireland that still exists, untouched by the progress, boom, and bust of recent years, recognisably "country".<br /><br />The most famous poem in this volume is "Mid-term break", describing Heaney's returning home to the funeral of his younger brother, once again perfectly recognisable as an Irish country removal and wake in a way that wouldn't be familiar elsewhere. Although I must say that my own favourite is "Storm on the Island" that describes how a storms comes over an empty West-of-Ireland landscape:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />We just sit tight while wind dives<br />And strafes invisibly. Space is a salvo,<br />We are bombarded by the empty air.<br />Strange, it is a huge nothing that we fear.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Sentiments I recognise in myself at every storm I sit out.<br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      Surrealist science fiction at its best. A selection of short stories told from the perspective of a being simultaneously almost god-like and hopelessly confused as the universe evolves around him (it?).<br /><br />It's a hard work to classify. My closest analogy would be with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18194.The_Cyberiad" title="The Cyberiad by StanisÅ‚aw Lem" rel="nofollow noopener">The Cyberiad</a>, but with less narrative consistency and a far broader scope. Still, it's extremely enjoyable, in a mind-bending way.

	4/5.

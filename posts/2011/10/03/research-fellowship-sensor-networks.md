School of Computer Science,  £32,751 - £35,788 per annum. Start: As soon as possible, Fixed Term 3 years

We seek a  Research Fellow to design and implement an integrated software platform  based on mission specifications and evolution operators. The work will  be evaluated based on case study deployments in the context of  real-world large-scale WSANs.  You will specifically focus on generative programming techniques to  integrate the overall design, and will work with Professors Dearle and  Dobson.

The project involves re-architecting WSAN systems so that system-wide  behaviour is defined using explicit mission specifications. These allow  top-level constraints and trade-offs to be captured directly and used to  inform software deployment and evolution in a well-founded manner. We  compile mission-level components to collections of node-level components  connected using network overlays. We maintain both mission constraints  and management interfaces through to run-time where they can be  manipulated by evolution and recomposition operators.

You should have a good honours degree in Computer Science or a related  discipline, and preferably have, or be about to obtain, a PhD in  Computer Science. You will have strong software  development/OS/programming language skills. Experience in generative  programming, compilers, operating systems, component deployment and/or  sensor networks would be advantageous.  You should be a highly motivated  individual and be able to lead the day-to-day work.

This is a fixed-term post for 3 years, starting as soon as possible.

<html><body><p>I'm talking at the <a href="http://www.bcs.org.uk">BCS</a> Edinburgh branch tonight about sensing and sensor-driven systems.

<!--more-->
</p><blockquote>It has been an old maxim in computing that incorrect inputs can  acceptably give rise to unacceptable outputs: "garbage in, garbage out".

This is ceasing to be true, and many  classes of systems must behave predictably even in the face of inputs  containing substantial garbage -- although researchers delicately use  terms like "imprecise" or "unstructured" instead of "garbage".

In this talk we discuss some approaches to managing the  problem of imprecise, inaccurate, untimely and partial inputs in the  context of pervasive and sensor-driven systems, and suggest that we need  to re-think radically the way we build software and represent  decision-making in these environments.</blockquote>

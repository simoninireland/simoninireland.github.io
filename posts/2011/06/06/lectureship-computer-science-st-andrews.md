</p><h1>Lectureship at St Andrews</h1>
<strong>Lecturer in Computer Science – SK8461</strong>

<a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> £36,862 – £45,336 per  annum. Starting September 2011 or as soon as possible thereafter. Standard  appointment.

The Scottish Informatics and Computer Science  Alliance (<a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk" target="_blank">SICSA</a>) is creating a world-leading Computer Science research  community across the universities in Scotland. As part of this  initiative, we seek lectureship applications from researchers with  expertise in the SICSA themes of Next Generation Internet; Complex  Systems Engineering; Multi-modal Interaction and Modelling &amp;  Abstraction. We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise  in sensor systems, multicore systems, embedded systems, data intensive  systems or wireless communications and especially those who bridge two  or more of these areas.

You should have a PhD and have an outstanding research record as  demonstrated by publications and research funding. You must be willing  to cooperate with other researchers across Scotland and contribute to  the work of SICSA and to teach in any area of computer science.

A period of postdoctoral experience and publications that reflect  your experience is essential. Teaching is important to us and we expect  candidates to be committed teachers, with appropriate experience. We  have a growing portfolio of Masters level courses and welcome those who  have an interest in contributing to their development.

Candidates interested in this post are welcome to informally contact  the Head of School (<a href="mailto:hos-cs@st-andrews.ac.uk" target="_blank">Alan Dearle</a>) to discuss the opportunity.

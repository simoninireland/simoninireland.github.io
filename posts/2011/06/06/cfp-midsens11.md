</p><h1>Sixth International Workshop on Middleware Tools, Services and  Run-time Support for Networked Embedded Systems (<a href="http://www.midsens.org/index.html" target="_blank">MidSens’11</a>)</h1>
<h2>Co-located with <a href="http://2011.middleware-conference.org/">Middleware 2011</a> (December 12th - December 16th, 2011), Lisbon, Portugal</h2>
The aim of MidSens’11 is to stimulate research in the  specific domain of middleware for networked embedded systems. This  year’s focus is on sensor networks and robotics control – a broader  focus than the previous editions – since we believe that the extended  scope will result in complementary and synergetic submissions from  researchers working in both niches. Along with the ‘core’ topic of  middleware architectures, services and tool support, MidSens’11 will  also seek quality papers describing novel programming languages,  run-time support and relevant experience reports. As with previous  editions of this workshop, MidSens’11 will investigate how middleware  support can relieve developers from low-level, platform specific  concerns, while enabling optimal exploitation of available resources. We  hope that you will be able to join us in Lisbon on December 12th 2011.

Middleware for networked embedded systems such as sensor networks and  robotics is a critical research domain which addresses key challenges  that application developers are facing today. The five previous editions  of this workshop (<a href="http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/conference/MidSens2006/">MidSens'06</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/conference/MidSens2007/">MidSens'07</a>, <a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/midsens08/">MidSens'08</a>, <a href="http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/events/midsens09/">MidSens'09</a> and <a href="http://www.midsens.org/2010/"> MidSens'10</a>)  attracted researchers from Europe, Asia, and the United States. The  MidSens workshop series has served to trigger and guide research efforts  to create an <em>integrated middleware vision</em>, which is required to  handle the challenges inherent in developing, deploying and managing  complex networked embedded applications in an efficient way.

<ul>
	<li>Middleware Tools and Architectures:

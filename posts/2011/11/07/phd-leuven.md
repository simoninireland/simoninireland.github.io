Wireless Sensor Networks are expected to play a key role in future  Internet architectures and the Internet of Things. The <a href="http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">DistriNet  research group of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a> wishes to expand  its Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) research team. You will play a key  role in a highly integrated team, which has a strong and growing  research profile in the area of middleware and software development  support for WSN. Three positions are available, starting immediately.

<em>Possible Research Topics:</em>
• System-level support for realizing WSN applications that are reliable  and reconfigurable from the lowest-levels of the network stack to the  application layer.
• Development-time support for building autonomic and reconfigurable  applications for networked embedded systems and sensor networks.
• Distributed component based software engineering approaches for  networked heterogeneous networked embedded systems such as sensors,  smart phones and web pads.

<em>Profile &amp; Skills:</em>
• The student must demonstrate significant enthusiasm for, and knowledge  of the subject area based upon their previous education, work and  research experience.
• A master degree in Computer Science or Informatics with previous  experience in: Distributed Systems, Middleware, Embedded Systems or  related areas.
• A team player with the capability to work in an international research team.
• Proficiency in English and excellent communication skills, both oral and written.

<em>About DistriNet:</em>

DistriNet is an international research group with extensive expertise in  secure and distributed software – obviously including middleware .   Research on software engineering techniques is performed in both domains  on a wide range of topics such as middleware for cloud computing,   internet architectures, network and software security, embedded systems  and multi-agent systems.  Embedded in the department of Computer Science  of the K.U.Leuven, DistriNet has a headcount of over 70 researchers of  which 9 professors and 15 Post-Docs.

DistriNet has a tradition of application driven research often in close  collaboration with industry partners. Currently DistriNet is actively  involved in about 35 national and international research projects,  ranging from fundamental over strategic-basic  to applied research. More  information on projects and publications can be found at the  IBBT-DistriNet web pages:  http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be.

The three open positions are situated within a team that has been  established to provide software development support for Wireless Sensor  Networks.

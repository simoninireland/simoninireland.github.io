The parts have arrived for the ditch project.

The first tranche of hardware came (in a small box) today:

![Enough parts for four sensors and a base station](/images/citizen-sensing//2013-06-19-14.14.06.jpg)

There are parts here for four sensor packages and a base station. The sensor nodes have an Arduino, a 2mW XBee radio, and a digital temperature sensor. The base station has an XBee and a wired ethernet for connecting up to the internet. There are also some prototyping shields to simplify integration, a wall wart power supply for the base station, and some other goodies to support some other development.

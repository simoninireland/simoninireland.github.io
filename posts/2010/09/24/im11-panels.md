</p><h1><!--more--><strong>IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011)</strong></h1>
Dublin, Ireland, 23-27 May 2011

<h2><strong>Call for panels</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
IM is one of the premier venues in network management, providing a forum for discussing a broad range of issues relating to network structure, services, optimisation, adaptation and management. This year's symposium has a special emphasis on effective and energy-efficient design, deployment and management of current and future networks and services.
We are seeking proposals for expert discussion panels to stimulate and inform the audience as to the current "hot topics" within network management. An ideal panel will bring the audience into a discussion prompted by position statements from the panel members, taking account of both academic and industrial viewpoints. We are interested in panels on all aspects of network management, especially those related to the theme of energy awareness and those discussing the wider aspects of networks and network management. This would include the following topics, amongst others:
<ul>
	<li>Multi-transport and multi-media networks</li>
	<li>Network adaptation and optimisation</li>
	<li>Co-managing performance and energy</li>
	<li>The uses and abuses of sensor networks</li>
	<li>The science of service design and implementation</li>
	<li>Programming network management strategies</li>
	<li>Tools and techniques for network management</li>
	<li>Socio-technical integration of networks</li>
	<li>Energy-efficiency vs equality of access</li>
	<li>Network-aware cloud computing</li>
	<li>The future of autonomic management</li>
	<li>Coping with data obesity</li>
	<li>Managing the next-generation internet</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to propose a panel</strong></h2>
Please send a brief (1-page) proposal to the panel chairs, <a href="mailto:sd@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk">Simon Dobson</a> and <a href="mailto:gp.parr@ulster.ac.uk">Gerard Parr</a>.

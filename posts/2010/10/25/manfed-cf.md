<div id="blog-description">1st IFIP/IEEE Workshop on Managing Federations and Cooperative Management</div>
<div id="manfed-location-header">Co-located with IM 2011 in Dublin, Ireland.</div>
<div id="manfed-date-header">May 23, 2011</div>
Management approaches that can be applied across  organisational boundaries are increasingly important in a wide range of  application areas. These range from algorithmic approaches which adapt  to the observed behaviour of third-party systems, based on  game-theoretic approaches or other predictive models, to explicit  organisational federations which adopt coherent solutions and management  models to facilitate interoperability among multiple independent  organisations.

There are a number of significant, common, complex issues which must  be addressed in all technologies and applications that involve federated  organisations – how to enable secure governance in the absence of a  single, central point of authority; how to achieve semantic  interoperability in the absence of common schema; how to provide  effective access control in the absence of common user and role models;  how to provide analytics and support for effective decision making;  how  to adapt to environments that can be highly dynamic as well as highly  heterogeneous; how to construct and maintain a common inter-domain  governance model in the presence of highly diverse local governance  infrastructures .

This workshop will, for the first time, bring together researchers  from a broad array of application and technical areas who are concerned  with cross-domain management. It will draw out common themes, problems  and issues encountered, and the solutions being designed to deal with  the problems of managing information systems that span autonomous  domains. It will aim to provide the basis for a common understanding and  common approaches to inter-domain management and governance that  synthesises the insights and best of breed solutions being developed in  the diverse areas in which these problems are encountered.
<h4>TOPICS TO BE ADDRESSED, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</h4>
Cross Domain and Federated Management Issues in the following areas:
<ul>
	<li>Governance mechanisms for federated environments, e.g. Policy Based Management</li>
	<li>Collaborative management, algorithmic adaptation, game theoretic approaches, predictive modeling.</li>
	<li>Modelling cross-domain relationships, i.e. Information models, formal specifications, languages for federation</li>
	<li>Distributed trust management and federated security systems</li>
	<li>Data federation</li>
	<li>Semantic technologies, semantic mapping and linked data</li>
	<li>Information security in federated environments</li>
	<li>Cloud &amp; grid computing management</li>
	<li>Software engineering for federated systems, i.e. tool chains, design by contract, model driven engineering and design patterns</li>
	<li>Model driven approaches for the generation of adaptive inter-domain relationships</li>
	<li>Adaptive analytics for the support of managing complex, dynamic multi-domain solutions</li>
</ul>

<h4>PAPER SUBMISSION</h4>
Authors are invited to submit full papers (8 pages) describing the  original work. All manuscripts must be written in English and should be  prepared in IEEE style. All submitted papers will be reviewed by the  ManFed.CoM Technical Program Committee.

For the review, all the papers should be submitted in PDF format through the ManFed.Com page on the JEMS system (<a href="https://jems.sbc.org.br/manfed2011">https://jems.sbc.org.br/manfed2011</a>), filling every item and uploading the respective papers.

The contributed papers, after being reviewed and accepted by  ManFed.CoM referees, will be published in the Conference Proceedings  that will be included in the IEEE Conference Publication of IM 2011 and  will be available on IEEE Xplore. The papers will also be indexed and  abstracted by several databases such as INSPEC, Engineering Index (EI),  SCOPUS, Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), etc.

Finally, the organizing committee are currently in discussions with  the editors of leading network and service management journals regarding  the publication of a special issue to include best submissions from the  workshop.

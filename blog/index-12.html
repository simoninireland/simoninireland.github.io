<p>Clearly saving battery power means getting the XBee radio to sleep at the behest of the Arduino. This turns out to be fairly simple, but does require modifying the XBee shield slightly.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Our <a href="2013/07/31/power/">previous measurements</a> indicate that the XBee draws about 45mA of current -- something we have to save for battery-powered nodes. Fortunately XBee radios have a hardware-controlled sleep mode, so the Arduino can sleep the radio when not in use.</p>
<p>Since XBees work as a <a href="2013/07/02/mesh-network/">mesh network</a>, it's clearly going to be an issue as to <em>when</em> a radio sleeps, and for how long -- since when asleep the radio can't route packets, and so the network starts to break down. But that's a higher-level concern: for the moment, we'll focus on the mechanics of getting the XBee to sleep.</p>
<p><img alt="Pins relating to XBee sleep mode" src="../images/citizen-sensing/sleep-pin.jpg"></p>
<p>The basic mechanism is simple, and involves hardware and software. At the hardware level, the XBee uses pin 9 (shown in red right) as a control pin. This pin can be used to sleep the radio: setting it to 3,3V ("high" or "asserted") causes the radio to sleep; setting it to 0V ("low" or "deasserted") wakes the radio up. The XBee only takes account of the pin when in certain sleep modes, however: these are analogous to the <a href="2013/07/23/arduino-watchdog/">Arduino's sleep modes</a>. This is the software part: the XBee needs to be placed into the correct sleep mode, and can then be controlled from the Arduino.</p>
<p>Also note I/O line 7, pin 12 (in green): we'll come back to this later.</p>
<p>We'll deal with the hardware part first, and then the software.</p>
<h3>Getting access to the sleep pin</h3>

<p>The XBee shield doesn't connect the sleep pin to anything by default, so to control it we have to connect it. There are several ways we could do this, with the simplest being to solder a wire from the pan on pin 9 to an appropriate header on the shield, which is then connected to a digital pin on the Arduino. For simplicity we'll start with a wire that's long enough to reach <em>any</em> header: we'll actually plug it into the header for the Arduino's D7 pin.</p>
<p>There's a slight concern about voltage levels in this approach, as the
Arduino operates at 5V while the XBee uses 3.3V. Experimentally this
doesn't seem to make a difference; for a production system we'd
probably want to create a resistor network to drop the voltage to that
needed by the radio, to avoid any risk of damage. We'd also probably
want to solder a header to XBee pin 9's pad to make it easier to
connect the wiring.</p>
<h3>Setting the sleep mode</h3>

<p>The XBee's sleep mode is controlled by a single AT command called (unsurprisingly) SM. The default (SM 0) is for the radio to be on all the time; SM 1 selects the pin-sleep mode described above, and is the one we'll be using as it places the radio under the (hardware) control of the Arduino. (There are other sleep modes where the radio sleeps under the control of its own internal timer. Some projects use the radio's timer to wake the Arduino rather than the other way round: we prefer to keep the Arduino in control.)</p>
<p>Setting the sleep mode is simply a matter of <a href="2013/08/02/at-commands-2">issuing the appropriate AT command</a>. However, as with a lot of things to do with hardware, we have to set things up slightly first.</p>
<p>The first issue concerns the setting of the XBee's sleep pin. If we
select pin-sleep mode with the pin high, the XBee will sleep
immediately, which might not be what we intended. So if we've
connected the sleep pin to D7, we need to set things up so that the
pin is low to keep the radio awake, and then select its sleep mode:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="cp">#define XBEE_SLEEP 7                </span><span class="c1">// Xbee sleep pin on D7</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setup</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="p">...</span>
   <span class="n">pinMode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">XBEE_SLEEP</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">OUTPUT</span><span class="p">);</span>     <span class="c1">// sleep control</span>
   <span class="n">digitalWrite</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">XBEE_SLEEP</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">LOW</span><span class="p">);</span>   <span class="c1">// deassert to keep radio awake when sleep mode selected</span>
   <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>(Some early mistakes showed that -- contrary to what might be expected -- the sleep pin defaults to high (send radio to sleep) rather than low. So this step is important.)</p>
<p>The next issue concerns the rather intricate behaviour of the XBee's other pins when sleeping. When the radio enters sleep mode, it asserts its I/O 7 line (pin 12) so that external devices know that it's asleep. This could be used to make sure that external peripherals wake up only when the radio is active, but for some reason the XBee shield's designers have connected this pin to the Arduino's reset line, which means that sleeping the radio will reset (and in fact freeze) the Arduino. <a href="http://rubenlaguna.com/wp/2009/03/05/setting-xbee-to-sleep-causes-arduino-reset/" target="_blank">Some posts suggest</a> that solving this requires cutting lines on the shield, which might have been true for earlier shields but now isn't: we simply need to disable the output of this pin, using another AT command:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">atCommand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"D7"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This disables the XBee's D7 line (not to be confused with the Arduino's D7 line, which we've attached to the XBee's sleep pin), which is enough to stop the Arduino freezing. on sleep. (Yes, this <em>did</em> take quite a while to work out, since you ask...)</p>
<p>We can now put all this together to place the XBee into SM 1  and let the Arduino sleep it at will:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="cp">#define LED 13</span>
<span class="cp">#define XBEE_SLEEP 7                </span><span class="c1">// XBee sleep pin on D7</span>

      <span class="p">...</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
   <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Note that we've used local AT commands to set the radio's mode. It's
also possible to do this <a href="../2013/07/xctu/">statically using
X-CTU</a>.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>

<p><img alt="XBee with sleep control" src="../images/citizen-sensing/xbee-sleep.jpg"></p>
<p>The results of all this hacking are that the Arduino can put the XBee into sleep mode whenever it wants to simply by asserting D7. The voltages on pins are maintained even when the Arduino itself sleeps, so it can put the radio to sleep and then sleep itself, wake up and wake up the radio.</p>
<p>Measuring current shows that the sleeping Arduino and XBee draw abour 35mA, the same as an Arduino alone. This makes sense, as the XBee datasheet suggests that when sleeping it draws current in the microamp range -- far too small for a normal ammeter to measure, and dwarfed by the quiescent current of the Arduino board (which still needs some work).</p>
<p>Waking the radio happens quickly when the sleep pin is deasserted, but it seems to take some time to re-connect to the mesh co-ordinator: around 7s, in fact, which is a little strange and needs some more exploration.</p>

<p>Controlling the XBee requires issuing AT commands. The XBee library has the low-level machinery to do this.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>AT commands are the basis for controlling almost all modems, and the XBee is no different. In API mode, AT commands are issued in a similar manner to sending data. The Arduino XBee library has the low-level code needed, which can be wrapped into a slightly easier-to-use form.</p>
<p>The basic approach is to send an AT command request packet and then
read a returned packet acknowledging the command. For the moment we'll
stick to "setting" commands, where the AT command takes an integer
parameter: the other are needed less frequently. We construct the
request packet, send it, read the response, and check that all went
well. This isolates the rest of the program from the message exchange,
but also hides the exact nature of any error.</p>

<p>Some initial measurements of power consumption.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>How much power does Arduino sleep mode save? The simplest way to work this out is to power an Arduino from a battery pack and measure the current being drawn in the different modes. A simple program to demonstrate the different modes is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal <code>delay()</code> loop</li>
    <li>Deep sleep for a period (deep sleep)</li>
    <li>Flash the LED (awake)</li>
    <li>Flash the LED differently while sending out radio messages (awake and transmitting)</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that SleepySketch makes it very easy to access the deep sleep mode, and to stay in it by default. This is good, as the normal approach of using <code>delay()</code> is quite power-hungry. The bad news is that the "at rest" power consumption of an Arduino even in deep sleep  -- the quiescent current being drawn by the voltage regulator and other components on the board, regardless of what the microcontroller is doing -- is about 35mA, with an XBee drawing an additional 40mA.There is very little difference in power whether the radio is transmitting or not (although the current being drawn looked more variable when transmitting, suggesting that there's some variation happening faster than the ammeter's sample time).</p>
<p>The radio isn't put to sleep when the Arduino is asleep, which is clearly something that needs to happen: it draws power even when the Arduino is incapable of using it. Something to explore. Potentially more serious is the power being drawn when the Arduino is asleep. A battery pack with 4 x 1500mAH batteries will be drained in about 7 days (6000mAH / 35mA) even with the system asleep all the time.</p>

<p>The current focus on "big data" may be obscuring something more interesting: it's often not the pure size of a dataset that's important.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The idea of extracting insight from large bodies of data promises significant advances in science and commerce. Given a large dataset, "big data" techniques cover a number of possible approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Look through the data for recurring patterns (data mining)</li>
    <li>Present a summary of the data to highlight features (analytics)</li>
    <li>(Less commonly) Identify automatically from the dataset what's happening in the real world (situation recognition)</li>
</ul>
There's a wealth of <a href="http://data.gov.uk/" target="_blank">UK government data available</a>, for example. Making it machine-readable means it can be presented in different ways, for example <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8294450/Crime-maps-are-just-the-beginning.html" target="_blank">geographically</a>. The real opportunities seem to come from cross-overs between datasets, though, where they can be mined and manipulated to find relationships that might otherwise remain hidden, for example the effects of crime on house prices.
<p>Although the size and availability of datasets clearly makes a difference here -- big open data -- we might be confusing two issues. In some circumstances we might be better looking for smaller but richer datasets, and for richer connections between them.</p>
<p><em>Big data</em> is a strange name to start with: when is data "big"? The only meaningful definition I can think of is "a dataset that's large relative to the current computing and storage capacity being deployed against it" -- which of course means that big data has always been with us, and indeed always will be. It also suggests that data might become less "big" if we become sufficiently interested in it to deploy more computing power to processing it. The alternative term popular in some places, <em>data science</em>, is equally tautologous, as I can't readily name a science that <em>isn't</em> based on data. (This isn't just academic pedantry, by the way: terms matter, if only to distinguish what topics are, and aren't, covered by big data/data science research.)</p>
<p>It's worth reviewing what big data lets us do. Having more data is useful when looking for patterns, since it makes the pattern stand out from the background noise. Those patterns in turn can reveal important processes at work in the world underlying the data, processes whose reach, significance, or even existence may be unsuspected. There may be patterns in the patterns, suggesting correlation or causality in the underling processes, and these can then be used for prediction: if pattern A almost always precedes pattern B in the dataset, then when I see a pattern A in the future I may infer that there's an instance of B coming. The statistical machine learning techniques that let one do this kind of analysis are powerful, but dumb: it still requires human identification and interpretation of the underlying processes to to conclude that A <em>causes</em> B, as opposed to A and B simply occurring together through some acausal correlation, or being related by some third, undetected process. A data-driven analysis won't reliably help you to distinguish between these options without further, non-data-driven insight.</p>
<p>Are there are cases in which less data is better? Our experience with situation recognition certainly suggests that this is the case. When you're trying to relate data to the the real world, it's essential to have <em>ground truth</em>, a record of what <em>actually</em> happened. You can then make a prediction about what the data indicates about the real world, and verify that this prediction is true or not against known circumstances. Doing this well over a dataset provides some confidence that the technique will work well against other data, where your prediction is all you have. In this case, what matters is not simply the size of the dataset, but its relationship to another dataset recording the actual state of the world: it's the <em>richness</em> that matters, not strictly the size (although having more data to train against is always welcome).</p>
<p>Moreover, rich connections may help with the more problematic part of data science, the identification of the processes underlying the dataset. While there may be no way to distinguish causality from correlation within a single dataset -- because they look indistinguishably alike -- the patterns of data points in the one dataset may often be related to patterns and data points in another dataset in which they <em>don't</em> look alike. So the richness provides a translation from one system to another, where the second provides discrimination not available in the first.</p>
<p>I've been struggling to think of an example of this idea, and this is the best I've come up with (and it's not all that good). Suppose we have tracking data for people around an area, and we see that person A repeatedly seems to follow person B around. Is A following B? Stalking them? Or do they live together, or work together (or even just close together)? We can distinguish between these alternatives by having a link from people to their jobs, homes, relationships and the like.</p>
<p>There's a converse concern, which is that poor discrimination can lead to the wrong conclusions being drawn: classifying person B as a potential stalker when he's actually an innocent who happens to follow a similar schedule. An automated analysis of a single dataset risks finding spurious connections, and it's increasingly the case that these false-positives (or -negatives, for that matter) could have real-world consequences.</p>
<p>Focusing on connections between data has its own dangers, of course, since we already know that we can make very precise classifications of people's actions from relatively small, but richly connected, datasets. Maybe the point here is that focusing exclusively on the size of a dataset masks both the advantages to be had from richer connections with other datasets, and the benefits and risks associated with smaller but better-connected datasets. Looking deeply can be as effective (or more so) as looking broadly.</p>

<p>It's funny how even early experiences change the way you think about a design. Two minor changes to SleepySketch have been suggested by early testing.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The first issue is obvious: milliseconds are a really inconvenient way to think about timing, especially when you're planning on staying asleep for long periods. A single method in SleepySketch to convert from more programmer-friendly days/hours/minutes/seconds times makes a lot of difference.</p>
<p>The second issue concerns scheduling -- or rather regular
scheduling. Most sampling and communication tasks occur on predictable
schedules, say every five hours. In an <a href="2013/06/01/actor-systems/" target="_blank">actor
framework</a>, that means the actor instance (or another one) has to
be re-scheduled after the first has run. We can do this within the
definition of the actor, for example using the <code>post()</code>
action:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">class</span> <span class="nl">PeriodicActor</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">public</span> <span class="n">Actor</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">();</span>
   <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">behaviour</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="p">...</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">PeriodicActor</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">post</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scheduleIn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">this</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">expandTime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>(This also demonstrates the <code>expandTime()</code> function to re-schedule after 0 days and 5 hours, incidentally.) Simple, but bad design: we can't re-use <code>PeriodicActor</code> on a different schedule. If we add a variable to keep track of the repeating period, we'd be mixing up "real" behaviour with scheduling; more importantly, we'd have to do that for <em>every</em> actor that wants to run repeatedly.</p>
<p>A better way is to use an actor combinator that takes an actor and a period and creates an actor that runs first re-schedules the actor to run after the given period, and then runs the underlying actor. (We do it this way so that the period isn't affected by the time the actor actually takes to run.)</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">Actor</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">RepeatingActor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">SomeActor</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">expandTime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scheduleIn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">expandTime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The <code>RepeatingActor</code> runs the behaviour of
<code>SomeActor</code> every 5 hours, and we initially schedule it to
run in 5 hours. We can actually encapsulate all of this by adding a
method to <code>SleepySketch</code> itself:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scheduleEvery</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">SomeActor</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">expandTime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">));</span>
</code></pre>


<p>to perform the wrapping and initial scheduling automatically.</p>
<p>Simple sleepy sketches can now be created at set-up, by scheduling
repeating actors, and we can define the various actors and re-use them
in different scheduling situations without complicating their own
code.</p>

<p>A simple radio survey establishes the ranges that the radios can manage.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The 2mW XBee radios we've got have a nominal range of 100m -- but that's in free air, with no obstructions like bushes, ditches, and houses, and not when enclosed in a plastic box to protect them from the elements. There's a reasonable chance that these obstacles will reduce the real range significantly.</p>
<p><img alt="Arduino, radio, batteries, and their enclosure in the field (literally)" src="../images/citizen-sensing/sensor-enclosure.jpg"></p>
<p>A radio survey is fairly simple to accomplish. We load software that talks to a server on the base station -- something as simple as possible, like sending a single packet with a count every ten seconds -- and keep careful track of the return values coming back from the radio library. We then use the only output device we have -- an LED -- to indicate the success or failure of each operation, preferably with an indication of <em>why</em> it failed if it did. (Three flashes for unsuccessful transmission, five for no response received, and so forth.) We then walk away from the base station, watching the behaviour of the radio. When it starts to get errors, we've reached the edge of the effective range.</p>
<p>With two sensor motes, we can also check wireless mesh networking. If we place the first mote in range of the base station, we should then be able to walk further and have the second mote connect <em>via</em> the first, automatically. That's the theory, anyway...</p>
<p>(One extra thing to improve robustness: if the radios lose connection or get power-cycled, they can end up on a different radio channel to the co-ordinator. To prevent this, the radio needs to have an ATJV1 command issued to it. The easiest way to do this is at set-up, <a href="2013/07/02/xctu/" target="_blank">through the advanced settings in X-CTU</a>.)</p>
<p>The results are fairly unsurprising. In an enclosure, in the field, with a base station inside a house (and so behind double glazing and suchlike) the effective range of the XBees is about 30--40m -- somewhat less than half the nominal range, and not really sufficient to reach the chosen science site: another 10--20m would be fine. On the other hand, the XBees mesh together seamlessly: taking a node out of range and placing another between it and the base station connects the network with no effort.</p>
<p>This is somewhat disappointing, but that's what this project is all about: the practicalities of sensor networking with cheap hardware.</p>
<p>There are several options to improve matters. A higher-powered radio would help: the 50mW XBee has a nominal range of 1km and so would be easily sufficient (and could probably be run at reduced transmission power). A router node halfway between base station and sensors could extend the network, and the cost of an additional non-sensing component. Better antennas on the 2mW radios might help too, especially if they could be placed outside the enclosure.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the radio segment is horrendously hard to debug with only a single LED for signalling. Adding more LEDs might help, but it's still a very poor debugging interface, even compared to printing status messages to the USB port.</p>

<p>Keeping the microcontroller asleep as much as possible is a key goal for a sensor system, so it makes sense to organise the entire software process around that.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The standard Arduino software model is, well, standard: programs ("sketches") are structured in terms of a <code>setup()</code> function that runs once when the system restarts and a <code>loop()</code> function that is run repeatedly. This suggests that the system spends its time running, which possibly isn't all that desirable: a sensor system typically tries to <a href="2013/07/23/arduino-watchdog">stay in a low-power mode</a> as much as possible. The easiest way to do this is to provide a programming framework that handles the sleeping, and where the active bits of the program are scheduled automatically.</p>
<p>There are at least two ways to do this. The simplest is a library that lets <code>loop()</code> sleep, either directly or indirectly. This is good for simple programs and not so good for more complicated ones, as it means that <code>loop()</code> encapsulates all the program's logic in a single block. A more modern and compositional approach is to let program fragments request when they want to run somehow, and have a scheduler handle the sleeping, waking up, and execution of those fragments. That lets (for example) one fragment decide at run-time to schedule another</p>
<p>If we adopt this approach,we have to worry about the fact that one fragment might lock-out another. A desktop system might use threads; this is more problematic for a microcontroller, but an alternative is to force all fragments to only execute for a finite amount of time, so that the scheduler always gets control back. This might lead to a fragment not running when it asked (if other fragments were still running), but if we assume that the system spends most of its time asleep anyway, there will be plenty of catch-up time. Doing this results in an <a href="2013/06/01/actor-systems/">actor system</a> where the fragments are actors that are scheduled from an actor queue.</p>
<p>Turning this into code, we get the <code>SleepySketch</code> library: a library for building Arduino sketches that spend most of their time sleeping.</p>
<p><img alt="SleepySketch design" src="../images/citizen-sensing/sleepysketch.png"></p>
<p>There are a few wrinkles that need to be taken care of for running on a resource-constrained system. Firstly, the number of actors available is fixed at start-up (defaulting to 10), so that we can balance RAM usage.(With only 2k to play with, we need to be careful). Secondly, we use a class to manage the sleeping functionality in different ways: a <code>BusySleeper</code> that uses the normal <code>delay()</code> function (a busy loop) with no power-saving functions, a <code>HeavySleeper</code> that uses the watchdog timer to shut the system down as far as possible, and possibly some other intermediate strategies. Actors are provided by sub-classing the <code>Actor</code> class and providing a behaviour. We also allow pre- and post-behaviour actions to define families of actors, for example sensor observers. We separate the code for an actor from its scheduling.</p>
<p>The standard library uses singleton classes quite a lot, so for example the <code>Serial</code> object represents the USB connection from an Arduino to its host computer and is the target for all methods. We use the same approach and define a singleton, <code>Sleepy</code></p>
<p>The program structure then loops something like this. If we assume
that we've defined an actor class <code>PingActor</code>, then we can
do the following:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setup</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="n">Serial</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">9600</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">HeavySleeper</span><span class="p">());</span>

   <span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scheduleIn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">PingActor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Ping!"</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mi">10000</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">loop</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="n">Sleepy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">loop</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The <code>setup()</code> code initialises the serial port and the sleepy sketch using a <code>HeavySleeper</code>, and then schedules an actor to run in 10000ms. The loop() code runs the actors while there are actors remaining to schedule. If the <code>PingActor</code> instance just prints its message, then there will be no further actors to execute and the program will end; alternatively the actor could schedule further actors to be run later, and the sketch will pick them up. The sketch will remain asleep for as long as possible (probably for over 9s between start-up and the first ping), allowing for some fairly significant power saving.</p>
<p>This is a first design, now just about working. It's still not as easy
as it could be, however, and needs some testing to make sure that the
power savings do actually materialise.</p>

<p>The Arduino has several sleep modes that can be used to reduce power consumption. The most useful for sensor networks is probably the one that uses the watchdog timer.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>[mathjax]</p>
<p>Powering-down the Arduino makes a lot of sense for a sensor network: it saves battery power allowing the system to survive for longer. Deciding <em>when</em> to power the system down is another story, but in this post we'll concentrate on documenting the mechanics of the process. The details are necessarily messy and low-level. (I've been greatly helped in writing this post by <a href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega328p.aspx?tab=documents" target="_blank">the data sheet for the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller</a> that's used in the Arduino Uno, as well as by <a href="http://donalmorrissey.blogspot.ie/2010/04/putting-arduino-diecimila-to-sleep-part.html" target="_blank">a series of blog posts by Donal Morrissey</a> that also deal with other sleep modes for the Atmel.)
</p>
<h3>Header files and general information</h3>
To use the watchdog timer, a sketch needs to include three header files:
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;avr/power.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>
<span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;avr/wdt.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>
</code></pre>


<p>These provide definitions for various functions and variables needed to control the watchdog timer and manage some of the other power functions.
</p>
<h3>Power modes</h3>
A power (or sleep) mode is a setting for the microcontroller that allows it to use less power in exchange of disabling some of its functions. Since a microcontroller is, to all intents and purposes, a small computer on a chip, it has a lot of sub-systems that may not be needed all the time. A power mode lets you shut these unneeded sub-systems down. The result saves power but reduces functionality.
<p>Power modes are pretty coarse control mechanisms, and can shut down more than you intend. If your project is basically software-driven, with the Arduino making all the decisions, then a "deep" power-saving mode is ideal; on the other hand, if you rely on hardware-based signals at all, a "deep" sleep will probably ignore your hardware and the Arduino may never wake up.</p>
<p>The watchdog timer is used to manage the "power-down" mode, the deepest sleep mode with the biggest power savings.
</p>
<h3>Watchdog timer</h3>
The Arduino's watchdog timer is a countdown timer that's driven by its own oscillator on the microcontroller. It's designed to run even when all the other circuitry is powered down, meaning that the microcontroller is drawing as little power as possible without actually being turned off completely.
<p>Why "watchdog" timer? The basic function of a watchdog timer is to "bite" after a certain period, where "biting" means raising an interrupt, re-setting the system, or both. A typical use of a watchdog is to make a system more robust to software failures. Since the watchdog is handled by the microcontroller's hardware, independent of any program being run, it will still bite even if the software gets stuck in an infinite loop (for example). Some designers set the watchdog ahead of complex operations, so that if the operation fails, the system will reset in a short amount of time and end up back in a known-good configuration. At the end of a successful operation, the program disables the watchdog (before it bites) and carries on. Of course this assumes that the operation completes before the watchdog bites, which means the programmer needs to have a good idea of how long it will take.
</p>
<h3>Setting the time-out period</h3>
It's as well to understand how watchdog timers on microcontrollers work. Typically they have a fairly coarse resolution, counting a fixed number of timer ticks before "biting" and performing some function. In the case of the Arduino, the watchdog timer is driven by the internal oscillator running at 128KHz and counts off some multiple of ticks before biting. This value -- the number of ticks counted -- is referred to as the "prescalar" for the timer.
<p>The prescalar is controlled by the values of four bits in the watchdog timer's control register, <code>WDTCSR</code>. To set them up, you pick the value of prescalar you want and set the appropriate bits. If the bits contain a number ( i ), then the watchdog will bite after ( (2048 &lt;&lt; i) / 128000 ) seconds. So ( i = 0) means the watchdog bites after 16ms; ( i = 1 ) produces  delay of 32ms; and so on up to ( i = 9 ) (the largest value allowed) means the watchdog bites after about 8s.</p>
<p>The word "about" is important here: the oscillator's exact frequency depends on the supply voltage to the chip and some other factors, meaning that you should be conservative about relying on the delay time.</p>
<p>Writing the appropriate value of ( i ) into the control register
involves representing ( i ) as a four-digit binary number and then
writing these bits into four bits of the register -- and unfortunately
these bits aren't consecutive. if ( i = 7 ) for example, then this
is 0b0111 in binary, so we write 1 into bits <code>WDP0</code>,
<code>WDP1</code> and <code>WDP2</code>, and 0 into bit
<code>WDP3</code>, and 0 into all the other bits:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">WDTCSR</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">WDP0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">WDP1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">WDP2</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The phrases of the form <code>(1 &lt;&lt; WDP0)</code> simply takes a binary digit 1 and shifts it left into bit position <code>WDP0</code>. The <code>|</code> symbols logically OR these bits together to generate the final bit mask that is assigned to the control register.</p>
<p>Actually there's a little bit more to it than this, as we can't change the watchdog's configuration arbitrarily. Instead we have to notify the chip that it's configuration is about to be changed, by setting two other bits in the control register and then performing the updates we want:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">WDTCSR</span> <span class="o">|=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">WDCE</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">WDE</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Setting <code>WDCE</code> enables changes in configuration to be made in the next few processor cycles, <em>i.e.</em> immediately. Setting <code>WDE</code> resets the timer.</p>
<p>Finally we enable the watchdog timer interrupts by setting bit
<code>WDIE</code>. When the watchdog timer bites, the microcontroller
executes an interrupt handler, re-starts the main program, and clears
<code>WDIE</code>. Any further interrupts, if the time is re-enabled,
will then cause a system reset.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">WDTCSR</span> <span class="o">|=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">WDIE</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>


<p>So the complete code the setting up the watchdog timer to bite in 2s is:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">set_sleep_mode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN</span><span class="p">);</span>              <span class="c1">// select the watchdog timer mode</span>

<span class="n">sleep_disable</span><span class="p">();</span>                                  <span class="c1">// prevent further sleeps&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</code></pre>


<h3> Interrupt handler</h3>

<p>What happens when the watchdog bites? It causes an interrupt that has to be handled before the program can continue. The interrupt could be used for all sorts of things, but there's often no point in worrying about it: but it still has to be there, to prevent the microcontroller just resetting. The following code installs a dummy interrupt handler:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">ISR</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">WDT_vect</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="cm">/* dummy */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The <code>WDT_vect</code> identifies the watchdog timer's interrupt vector.</p>
<p>While this might seem like a waste of time, it's important to have an interrupt handler as the default behaviour of the watchdog timer is to reset the microcontroller, which we want to avoid. It's also worth noting that, once enabled, the watchdog timer will keep biting, so the interrupt handler will be called repeatedly. (Put a print statement in the hander to see.) This doesn't cause any problems.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Where does mathematics end and computer science begin?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I don't seem to have posted to this blog recently, so let's re-start with a big question: where is the edge of computer science? That is to say, what separates it from maths? How do mathematicians and computer scientists see problems differently, and indeed select differently what constitutes an interesting problem?</p>
<p>This has been on my mind recently because of some work I've been doing with my student <a href="http://saray.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Saray</a> on adaptive complex networks. A complex network is one that has statistical regularity in the distribution of the wires, or links, between its nodes. The internet is a complex network where the links obey a power-law distribution: a small number of sites (Yahoo, Google, IBM, ...) have a huge number of links to them, while the majority (this site) have almost none. Complex networks are created naturally by lots of processes, and are useful for describing a whole range of phenomena. (An accessible introduction is Albert-László Barabási. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Linked-Everything-Connected-Business-Everyday/dp/0452284392" target="_blank">Linked: how everything is connected to everything else, and what it means for business and daily life</a>. 2003.) An <em>adaptive</em> complex network is one where the way the network is wired changes with time. A good example is a meeting-with-friends network where there is a link between you and those people you meet in a particular timeframe. You might change the people you meet if you discover that one of them is ill, for example, so the the friend-meeting network would be re-wired to remove links to your sick friends. If we were to model the spread of an illness through this network, there would be two processes at work: a spreading process that made people who met sick people ill themselves (with some probability); and a re-wiring process that tried to remove links to those friends known to be sick (again perhaps with some probability). Our paper (Saray Shai and Simon Dobson. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.87.042812" target="_blank">Complex adaptive coupled networks</a>. Physical Review E <strong>87</strong>(4). 2013.) shows how there are unsuspected subtleties in the way spreading processes work on such networks, where common simplifications can actually hide crucial features of the network's behaviour.</p>
<p>The literature on network science is full of papers analysing such processes. Typically the analysis is both analytic and numerical. That is to say, a mathematical model is developed that describes the state of the network after lots of time has passed (its <em>equilibrium behaviour</em>); and numerical simulation is then performed by creating a large number of networks, running the spreading processes on them, and seeing whether the results obtained match the analytical model. (It was an unexpected mis-match between analytical and numerical results that led us to the main result reported in our paper.) Typically the community finds analytical results more interesting than numerical results, and with good reason: an analytic result provides both a final, closed-form solution that can be used to describe <em>any</em> network with particular statistical properties, without simulation; and it often also provides insight into <em>why</em> a given equilibrium behaviour occurs. These are the sorts of general statements that can lead to profound understanding of wide ranges of phenomena.</p>
<p>There's a sting in the tail of analysis, however, which is this. In order to be able to form an analytic model, the process being run over the network has to be simple enough that the mathematics converges properly. A typical analysis might use a probabilistic re-wiring function, for example, where nodes are re-wired with a fixed probability, or one that varies only slowly. Anything more complex than this defeats analysis, and as a result one never encounters anything other than simple spreading processes in the literature.</p>
<p>As a computer scientist rather than a mathematician I find that unsatisfying, and I think my dissatisfaction may actually define the boundary between computing and mathematics. The boundary is the halting problem -- or, more precisely, sustaining your interest in a problem once you've hit it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" target="_blank">halting problem</a> is one of the definitive results in computer science, and essentially says that there are some problems for which it's impossible to predict ahead of time whether they'll complete with a solution or simply go on forever. Put another way, there are some problems where the only way to determine what the solution is is to run a piece of code that computes it, and that may or may not deliver a solution. Put yet another way, there are problems for which the code that computes the solution is the most concise description available.</p>
<p>What this has to do with complex systems is the following. When a computer scientist sees a problem, they typically try to abstract it as far as possible. So on encountering a complex network, our first instinct is to build the network and then build the processes running on it <em>as separate descriptions that can be defined independently</em>. That is, we don't limit what kind of functions can hang off each node to define the spreading process: we just allow <em>any</em> function -- any piece of code -- and then run the dynamics of the network with that code defining what happens at each node at each timestep. The immediate consequence of this approach is that we can't say anything <em>a priori</em> about the macroscopic properties of the spreading process, because to do so would run into the fact that there isn't anything general one can say about an arbitrary piece of code. The generality we typically seek precludes our making global statements about behaviour.</p>
<p>Mathematicians don't see networks this way, because they want to make precisely the global statements that the general approach precludes -- and so don't allow arbitrary functions into the mix. Instead they use functions that aggregate cleanly, like fixed-probability infection rates, about which one <em>can</em> make global statements. One way to look at this is that well-behaved functions allow one to make global statements about their aggregate behaviour without having to perform any computation <em>per se</em>: they remain within an envelope whose global properties are known. A mathematician who used an ill-behaved function would be unable to perform analysis, <em>and that's precisely what they're interested in doing</em>, even though by doing so they exclude a range of possible network behaviours.In fact, it's worse than that: the range of behaviours excluded is infinite, and contains a lot of networks that seem potentially very interesting, for example those whose behaviours depend on some transmitted value, or one computed from values spread by the process.</p>
<p>So a mathematician's (at least as represented in most of the complex systems literature) interest in a problem is lost at precisely the point that a computer scientist's interest kicks in: where the question is about behaviour of arbitrary computations. The question this leads to is, what model do real-world networks follow more closely? Are they composed of simple, well-behaved spreading processes? Or do they more resemble arbitrary functions hanging off a network of relationships, whose properties can only be discovered numerically? And what effect does the avoidance of arbitrary computation have on the choice of problems to which scientists apply themselves? Perhaps the way forward here is to try to find the boundary of the complexity of functions that remain analytic when used as part of a network dynamics, to get the best of both worlds: global statements about large categories of networks, without needing numerical simulation of individual cases.</p>
<p>Such a classification would have useful consequences for general computer science as well. A lot of the problems in systems design come from the arbitrariness of code and its interactions, and from the fact that we're uncomfortable restricting that generality <em>a priori</em> because we don't know what the consequences will be for the re-usability and extensibility of the systems being designed. A more nuanced understanding of behavioural envelopes might help.</p>

<p>Any sensor network has to represent sampled data somehow. What would be the most friendly format for so doing?</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Re-usable software has to take an extensible view of how to represent data, since the exact data that will be represented may change over time. There are several approaches that are often taken, ranging from abstract classes and interfaces (for code-based solutions) to formats such as XML for data-based approaches.</p>
<p>Neither of these is ideal for a sensor network, for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>A typical sensor network architecture will use different languages one the sensors and the base station, with the former prioritising efficiency and compactness and the latter emphasising connectivity to the internet and interfacing with standard tools. Typically we find C or C++ on the sensors and Java, JavaScript, Processing, or some other language on the base station. (Sometimes C or C++ too, although that's increasingly rare for new applications.) It's therefore tricky to use a language-based approach to defining data, as two <em>different</em> versions of the <em>same</em> structure would have to be defined and -- more importantly -- kept synchronised across changes.</p>
<p>That suggests a data-based approach, but these tend to fall foul of the need for a compact and efficient encoding sensor-side. Storing, generating, and manipulating XML or RDF, for example, would typically be too complex and too memory-intensive for a sensor. These formats also aren't really suitable for in-memory processing -- unsurprisingly, as they were designed as transfer encodings, not primary data representations. Even though they might be attractive, not least for their friendliness to web interactions and the Semantic Web, they aren't really usable directly.</p>
<p>There are some compromise positions, however. <a href="http://www.json.org" target="_blank">JSON</a> is a data notation derived initially from JavaScript (and usable directly within it) but which is sufficiently neutral to be used as an exchange format in several web-based systems. JSON essentially lets a user form objects with named fields, whose values can be strings, numbers, arrays, or other objects. (Note that this doesn't include code-valued fields, which is how JSON stays language-neutral: it can't encode computations, closures, or other programmatic features.)</p>
<p>JSON's simplicity and commonality have raised the possibility of using it as a universal transport encoding: simpler than XML, but capable of integration with RDF, ontologies, and the Semantic Web if desired. There are several initiatives in this direction: one I came across recently is <a href="http://json-ld.org/" target="_blank">JSON-LD</a> (JSON for Linked Data) that seeks to integrate JSON records directly into the <a href="http://linkeddata.org/" target="_blank">linked open data world</a>.</p>
<p>This raises the possibility of using JSON to define the format of sensor data samples, sample collections (datasets), and the like, and linking those descriptions directly to ontological descriptions of their contents and meaning. There are some problems with this, of course. Foremost, JSON isn't very compact, and so would require more storage and wireless bandwidth than a binary format. However, one approach might be to define samples <em>etc</em> in JSON format and then either use them directly (server-side) or compile them to something more static but more efficient for use sensor-side and for exchange. This would retain the openness but without losing performance.</p>

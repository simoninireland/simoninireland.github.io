<p>Virtual machines are now commonplace in industry and academia. They
offer huge flexibility in managing large and/or complicated
installations. But what about for individual use, as a power user and
developer? Would that work? Would it be worth it? In the interests of
science, I decided to find out.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I'm a long-time Linux and Mac user. But Macs are rapidly ceasing to be
computers in the normal sense as OS X converges with IOS, and that's
not a direction I'm comfortable with. And of course Mac laptops are
eye-wateringly expensive. Even though I don't typically buy my own
machines, I think it's time to embrace my inner Linux recidivist.</p>
<p>I started thinking: what's the best set-up for a new computing
environment? I realised that, if I was starting from scratch with a
server, I'd do a minimal bare-metal installation and have everything
else containerised using <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a> or
<a href="https://podman.io">Podman</a>. That way all the services are isolated
and can be ungraded independently, with the bare metal part being just
enough to run the containers.</p>
<p>But then I thought that the same arguments apply to the desktop
environment too. Could I put just enough on the bare metal to run a
hypervisor, and then run the "real" user computing environment in a
virtual machine (VM)? What would be the trade-offs?</p>
<p>The covid-19 pandemic then led to my working from home. Sitting under
the desk in my study was my home server, used mainly for backups and
media. The temptation to experiment proved irresistible.</p>
<h2>Setting up the host</h2>
<p>The server was a 2012-vintage <a href="http://uk.shuttle.com/">Shuttle XPC</a>
with two twin-core Intel i5 processors and 8Gb of memory, a 256Gb SSD
and a 4Tb spinning-rust data disc. Perhaps not enough for all I had in
mind, so I upgraded to 16Gb and a 512Gb SSD from <a href="https://www.mrmemory.co.uk/">Mr
Memory</a>, who make the whole process
ridiculously easy and quick. Having the data all on its own disc made
life a lot easier too, of course, since I could simply swap out the
boot SSD without losing the megabytes of data files. </p>
<h3>Host OS</h3>
<p>The server had been running <a href="https://scientificlinux.org/">Scientific
Linux</a>, which is approaching end of life
and is anyway designed as an end-user distro and not a minimal
host. So the first software choice was for the Linux distro to use on
the bare metal. That was actually easy: if you want to go minimal,
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> is the logical choice, since
it comes stripped-down by default.</p>
<p>Burning an Arch installer to a USB stick is very
easy. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">Installation</a>
is from the command line -- no graphical installer here! -- but
straightforward if you're comfortable with working in a shell. The
flexibility is sometimes daunting, and it's easy to forget something
fairly essential, but I had soon had everything running. "Everything,"
of course, was not very much: networking, an X Server, Firefox, and
Docker, plus enough utilities to debug and configure as required. I
mounted the data disc onto <code>/mnt/data</code> and had a working system ready
to be populated.</p>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>The two services I wanted were <a href="https://owncloud.com/">OwnCloud</a> for
backups and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> for media. I had all the data
sitting on my data disc already, to the trick was to get a
containerised service to access what I already had.</p>
<p>Both services already have containerised versions of themselves
available, complete with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker
Compose</a> files to orchestrate
them. The only issue was therefore to change from using Docker volumes
to use the volumes I already had built from earlier. The same
procedure applies for Plex, giving it access to all my media.</p>
<h3>Gateway to the internet</h3>
<p>Some people worry that pre-built containers have security holes -- or
at least make security decisions that they disagree with. This was
the case for me with OwnCloud, which by default runs over HTTP. Rather
than start changing the container setup I instead used
<a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a> to map an HTTPS connection to the
outside world to a local HTTP port which I thn mapped to the port
exported by the OwnCloud container.</p>
<h2>A virtual machine for everyday</h2>
<p>The stage is now set to create a virtual machine on which to run user
processes. Just to recap, we now have a bare-metal Arch installation
running some containerised services, and are looking to build a VM
for me to use as a "normal" everyday machine.</p>
<h3>Virtualisation</h3>
<p>Docker provides <em>containers</em>, not <em>virtual machines</em>: the difference is
subtle but vital, and in fact makes a great interview question to see
whether someone knows what they're talking about with regard to
virtualisation technology.</p>
<p>Containerisation creates an isolated userspace within which processes
run. All the processes are visible to, and controlled by, the host --
a fact that can be confusing when you run <code>ps</code> and see, for example,
an Apache web server running when you deliberately didn't install
Apache, but it's been installed and is running within one of your
containers. There is however only one kernel running, with all the
containers and their processes running on top of it. The container
manages the name spaces for file descriptors, processes, and other
elements that are made available through the shared kernel.</p>
<p>A virtual machine, by contrast, has its own "guest" kernel as well as
its own userspace, being managed by a hypervisor on the host. A VM can
be running the same operating system as the host, or a variant, or a
completely different one, since it has its own kernel. It can even
have a different processor architecture to the host, allowing an
Intel machine, for example, to emulate a MIPS to run a MIPS operating
system and applications. That this is slow from within the guest
(since the hardware it assumes it's running on is actually a software
emulation) doesn't detract from the flexibility virtualisation
gives. And if you don't opt for this flexibility and simply expose the
host's architecture to the guest, there's often remarkably little
performance degradation <em>versus</em> running on bare metal.</p>
<p>Linux has kernel-level virtualisation through a system called
<a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/">kvm</a>, accessed through a general system
emulator called <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>. What this means is that
QEMU manages the virtual machines, either emulating them in software
(for architectures different to that of the host) or running them
natively alongside the host's OS (for the same architecture) using
kvm, at pretty much full native speed in most cases.</p>
<p>If you're running a headless server you can manage VMs directly from
the command line. Since my host has a display, I opted to go slightly
less old-school and install a GUI VM manager,
<a href="https://virt-manager.org/">virt-manager</a>, that can create, provision,
start, and stop VMs. You could also use
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, which trades slightly less
flexibility for a slightly more accessible user interface.</p>
<h3>Choosing the guest OS</h3>
<p>Since we're virtualising, the OS in the guest can be anything: it
doesn't have to be Arch like on the host. This is hugely flexible.
<a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>,
<a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Mint</a>, and the other end-user-facing Linux
distros are all options (as is Windows, and even OS X if you're
prepared to ignore the licensing terms that prohibit running on
non-Apple hardware).</p>
<p>Since my server is quite old and not exactly bursting with memory, I
realised that the modern distros might struggle a little, so I opted
to use Arch again. That way I could add whatever level of complexity
and eye candy I wanted, without committing up-front to (for example) a
huge window manager.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: <em>the choice matters a lot less than you think</em>,
because you can easily change it. It's a pain to change the distro on
the bare metal, but trivial to change that of a virtualised
guest. It's perfectly possible to create multiple guests and run them
as test environments before spending too much time setting them up, or
to change your mind and set up a different one when you feel like a
change -- something that happens to me about once every year when I
see someone else's setup and get distro envy. Or when there's a new
version of <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-linux-distros/">this year's best
distros</a>
you can try out an <a href="https://getsol.us/home/">interesting-looking one</a>
without having too much to do if you decide you've made a mistake.</p>
<h3>Virtual storage</h3>
<p>In the same way that a VM is virtual, so too can disc storage be. A
virtual machine gets a virtual disc image, typically a "container"
(that word again) format which is actually a single file on the host's
(physical) disc that contains the image of a complete file system
mounted into the guest.</p>
<p>This might sound strange, but it has a lot of advantages. Firstly, you
can decide how large the disc should be, and so how much disc storage the
guest gets. This then means there's no way it overrun and take over
the host's entire storage capacity, which makes things more
stable. Secondly it makes it easy to backup a guest's whole file system,
since it's "really" just a single file as far as the host is
concerned. Finally, the guest can of course have multiple virtual
discs mounted into its file hierarchy, just like a bare-metal machine
can have multiple physical discs -- and you can create new ones as
needed, up to the size of physical discs available on the host.</p>
<p>There are several disc image formats available. If you need to
interoperate with other systems then this choice might be important,
but in the main it's safe to go with the default,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qcow">QCOW2</a>. This is efficient and
flexible -- in somewhat unexpected ways, as we'll see later. Virtual
Box uses a different format, VDI, but (as with a lot of things in this
virtual universe) you can convert between image file formats fairly
easily if it's ever required. </p>
<h3>Building the guest</h3>
<p>To build a guest you need its install media, typically an ISO
file. You then create a new VM that will run, virtually, the
installation process. This provisioning process determines the
(virtual) hardware available to the new VM. Most important are the
amount of memory and number of cores made available, and also the size
of any disc drives attached to the VM. One of these discs will become
the boot disc for the VM onto which the installation media will place
its operating system.</p>
<p>As you might be suspecting from the previous section, the choices made
here are less important than they might first appear because they can
always be changed later: there's no "real" hardware being created, of
course, and so it can all be changed easily.</p>
<p>In particular, QEMU provides a simple virtual (of course) network for
the guest, which it then connects to its own internet connection using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a>. In
other words, QEMU behaves in the same way as most home routers do,
letting other machines (the guest) "hide" behind the single IP address
of the host. This isn't the best choice, but we'll just optimise it
later: isn't virtualisation wonderful?</p>
<p><code>virt-manager</code> provides a user interface to VM creation and
provisioning. Once done, we arrive happily in the situation where the
desktop of the host shows <code>virt-manager</code>'s management console and a
window containing the guest, in which we can see an editor window open
on this post.</p>
<p><img alt="Guest on host" src="../../../../../images/posts/20201030-host.png"></p>
<h3>User data</h3>
<p>What about a home directory? You could of course allocate a large
enough boot disc and store your data there -- perhaps restored into
the guest from the OwnCloud service running on the host?</p>
<p>I think a cleaner way is to create another virtual volume on the host
and mount it into the guest. This has a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can decide how much space you want to give to your home
  directory.</li>
<li>It's just a single file (from the host's perspective), so easy to
  copy and backup if needed.</li>
<li>You can do all sorts of funky things with RAID on the host,
  independently of the guest. </li>
<li>You can encrypt it independently of the boot disc.</li>
<li>You can share the same home directory -- at different times! -- with
  different guest OS set-ups.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were going to use anything other than Linux you'd want to
create the home directory using a file system that can be read by all
the OSs you intend to use. For Linux world, I chose ext4 with
encryption, populated from the OwnCloud synchronisation copy.</p>
<h2>Tuning</h2>
<p>Just as you have to decide how big a hard disc to buy and how much
memory to put into your host, you have decisions to make about the
memory, processors, and disc storage available to the guest.</p>
<p>To state the obvious: the guest can't have more memory than the host
has, or more cores, or more disc space. In fact it can't even have <em>as
much</em> as the host, as the host needs to keep some for itself, to run
the hypervisor (and containerised services, in my case). But within
these constraints we have essentially free rein.</p>
<p>Exactly how you decide to make these decisions is a matter for
you. For myself, I decided I wanted to make a lot of power available
to my guest (since it'd be my everyday machine) while retaining enough
for the host to operate properly. Implicit in this is that I would
only be running one guest at a time, which makes sense for a user
machine but might not in some developer scenarios when you might want
a development VM <em>and</em> a service VM running simultaneously and
communicating.</p>
<h3>Guest resources</h3>
<p>I've already mentioned the decision on storage: I built a 20Gb boot
disc image located on my host's 512Gb SSD (for speed), and a 400Gb
home directory disc image located on the host's 4Tb data disc along
with my media and other data. (Access times to the home directory
aren't as time-critical as those for the operating system and
programs.)</p>
<p>For cores, I gave the guest 2 of the 4 cores available. I also gave it
12Gb of the 16Gb of memory available. The 4Gb remaining for the host
was enough to run the hypervisor and containers comfortably. 12Gb
isn't a huge amount of memory for a modern desktop, especially if you
do software development, but it's decent enough as a proof of concept,
and you can save memory by choices like a lightweight window manager
(<a href="https://www.lxde.org/">LXDE</a> in my case) if desired.</p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>I mentioned earlier that the QEMU default networking setup uses
NAT. This is simple, portable, and not especially fast: the host has
to do some work managing the translated addresses. You can speed
things up by creating a bridge network to which you attach the host's
physical ethernet device, and then connect this bridge to the guest's
(virtual) ethernet adaptor. This can require changes in DHCP set-up at
the router so that the guest gets leased an IP address.</p>
<h2>Evaluation: is it all worth it?</h2>
<p>If you're still with me, you must be wondering if this was worth it. I
can answer that in several ways. The short answer would be that I'm writing
this article on my "everyday VM", which I've been using now for a
month or so, so it can't be <em>too</em> bad. The longer answer is that there
have been several pros and cons, which I'll present below so you can
make your own mind up.</p>
<h3>Pro: Stability</h3>
<p>The VM system is very stable: there seems to be no stability cost from
virtualising, and little or no performance cost. I've had no crashes
of the host at all, in fact.</p>
<p>The use of containers for services is a benefit too: less
configuration (usually no) and less chance of conflicts with other
services. The orchestrated containers are essentially pre-configured
services to which you make storage available.</p>
<p>The guest has had problems once or twice, but here virtualisation is
an advantage: I can shut down the VM and still have a working
computer. In one instance this helped me debug what was happening,
because the host's logs pointed me in the direction of a problem in
the guest, which wasn't  immediately evident from the guest's logs:
that made things enormously easier to fix.</p>
<h3>Pro: Fixing mistakes, re-sizing the boot disc</h3>
<p>Since resources are virtual, there's a tendency to under-allocate
them. In my particular case I thought a 20b boot disc would be
perfectly bit enough, only to run out of space as I used the machine
more.</p>
<p>If I'd made this mistake for a real machine, I'd've had to
re-partition the disc. With a virtual disc image, however, it's fairly
straightforward to <a href="https://fatmin.com/2016/12/20/how-to-resize-a-qcow2-image-and-filesystem-with-virt-resize/">re-size make the image larger and then re-size the
filing system it
contains</a>
-- and a 20Gb boot disc is suddenly a 48Gb boot disc. That's an
enormous saving of time and effort from going virtual. The same would
be the case for the home directory disc, of course. </p>
<h3>Pro/Con: Use of resources</h3>
<p>Having retained 4Gb and 2 cores for the host, I immediately started to
worry whether this was too little. No, it turns out: the containers
and hypervisor all run happily. So, then, is it too much? Perhaps a
little: the host might get by with 3Gb and one core. The wider issue
is that, if the user machine was real, it'd have all the resources of
the physical machine to manage; as a guest, that decision is made <em>a
priori</em> and may result in some memory (for example) not being used to
its best advantage.</p>
<p>I suspect that if I had 32Mb of physical memory and 16 cores I'd be
worrying a lot less. But there's certainly the potential to
under- or over-allocate resources when splitting between host and
guest. This would be exacerbated in the case of multiple guests.</p>
<h3>Con: Removable media</h3>
<p>If you plug a USB drive into the physical machine, it appears on the
host, not the guest. This confused me the first time it happened,
because I'd kind of forgotten I was using a virtual guest. You can fix
it easily enough by telling <code>virt-manager</code> to map the drive (or indeed
other USB device) through to the guest: I do that for my camera. But
it's hardly plug-and-play. </p>
<h3>Con: Video conferencing</h3>
<p>The audio on video conferencing systems like Microsoft Teams stutters
badly. (The video seems fine, as is audio when just playing video:
it's the interactive audio that's a problem, with lots of noise and
echoes.) This may simply be a mis-configuration, or it might be a
place where virtualisation incurs a cost over bare metal -- or could
be that my 2012-vintage physical cores can't handle the modern codecs
properly. This is clearly an issue when working from home in the
pandemic, and means I have my Mac kept live purely for meetings, at
least for the time being.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Actually I think I missed out the biggest pro:</p>
<p>If I decide that I can indeed move fully to Linux for all my
computing, I'll buy a bigger machine (laptop or desktop, or possibly
both). In that case my VM will move trivially to the new machine:
there'll be no re-installing, just copy a couple of (rather large)
files over onto the (hopefully larger) host and boot up. That's a
<em>major</em> simplification compared to most machine upgrades, and it comes
purely from virtualising the machine on which you do most of the work
and customisation, sitting it on top of a stable and persistent host
and hypervisor. That's enough to make me think I'll stick with the
virtual life.</p>

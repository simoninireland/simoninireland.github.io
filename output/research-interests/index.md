My current research covers four main related areas: complex systems,
data interpretation, sensor networks, and blended approaches to
learning. I’m interested both in the core computer science of these
areas, but also increasingly in how they work across the traditional
disciplinary boundaries.


## Complex systems

I’m especially interested using complex networks to
model real-world phenomena like **disease epidemiology** and flooding. In
particular I’m interested in **adaptive and coupled networks**, where
several independent networks are coupled together somehow so that they
affect each others’ behaviours, and whose connections can change in
response to events.

As part of this work I've written an accessible introduction to
[modelling epidemics on networks](/pages/introduction-to-epidemics/)
and I’m writing a [textbook]/pages/cncp/) to
make the subject more accessible to computer scientists.
I'm also building and a library for [simulating](/pages/epydemic/)
epidemic (and other) network processes


## Sensor analytics and data interpretation

Sensor data provides a picture of
the real world, but one that’s limited and error-prone. Interpreting
the data is very challenging, and I work extensively on **situation and
activity recognition** techniques that fuse multi-model data together to
draw conclusions about what’s happening in the area under observation.


## Sensor networks

Sensors collect data, and sensor networks allow very precise and
long-lived observations to be made of phenomena that are otherwise
hard to observe. I work on **error management** to reduce noise and other
problems in the data stream. This has led to an interest in using
algebraic topology for these problems, which in turn led me to write a
[library for simplicial topology](/pages/simplicial/).

I'm also interested in **sensor network software design**, especially
building scientific-standard systems using off-the-shelf components so
that experimental groups can deploy more and better sensing
capabilities. Most of my work in this area is directed through the
Science of Sensor Systems Software programme grant on which I’m a
Principal Investigator along with colleagues from Glasgow, Liverpool,
and Imperial College.


## Blended learning

As a university we currently serve the a cohort of “digital natives”
who’ve grown up with the internet and digital technology. How does
this change teaching? How do we use technology to improve learning, to
make students more capable of being engaged and creative citizens? I’m
experimenting with blended approaches to my own teaching, with some
slightly surprising results.

Hi,

I’m a computer scientist, a wannabe mathematician/astronaut, and a photographer.
My main research interests these days are in complex systems, data science, sensing,
and data interpretation.

I work at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk) and live in
[Kilconquhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilconquhar) in Fife.
Originally I’m from [Runcorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runcorn), just
outside Liverpool in the north-west of England. I came to St Andrews by way of
Newcastle upon Tyne, York, Oxford, Dublin, and Co Sligo: good luck tracing my accent.

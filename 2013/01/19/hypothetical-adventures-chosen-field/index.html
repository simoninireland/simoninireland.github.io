		<p>A discussion on the different styles of PhD thesis that might be
appropriate for different students and research&nbsp;areas.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I was talking to one of my students about the &#8220;shape&#8221; of their PhD,
and how we might present the work they&#8217;re doing in the final thesis.
This particular student is working on the science of complex coupled
networks, which is a very new area of network science &#8212; itself a
pretty new field. The exact details of her work aren&#8217;t important: the
important point is that it&#8217;s an area that&#8217;s so poorly understood that
it&#8217;s hard to ask meaningful detailed questions about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>A PhD is a training in research: the work done in the course of one
doesn&#8217;t usually change the world, and a fact that&#8217;s often forgotten is
that <em>they&#8217;re not supposed to</em>. The goal of a PhD is to
demonstrate that the candidate can conceive of, plan, conduct,
evaluate a communicate a programme of research, sustained over
typically three or four years, that adds something to human knowledge.
Clearly there are many ways one can demonstrate this, and the question
we were asking was: what are the variations? How do we choose which is&nbsp;appropriate?</p>
<p>A typical thesis is a monograph, written specially to describe the
research, its process and results. In this it&#8217;s very different from a
scientific paper, which typically focuses on a single result and often
elides a lot of the motivation and process. Publications along the way
always help, of course: they let a reader (or examiner) know that the
work being presented has been reviewed by others in the field, which
always gives a certain amount of confidence that it contains
worthwhile results. (Few things make a PhD examiner&#8217;s heart sink more
than a thesis with no associated publications. It means you&#8217;re on your
own in terms of assessing every aspect of the work.) The monograph
needs a &#8220;shape&#8221;, a skeleton upon which to hang the research, as well
as clearly-enumerated contributions to knowledge and an understanding
of its own&nbsp;boundaries.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of different styles of skeletal&nbsp;structure.</p>
<p><strong>The hypothesis.</strong> This is my favourite, truth be told.
The work is encapsulated in a question, and the rest of the thesis
seeks to answer this question. The answer might be yes, no, or maybe,
all of which can be valid and can result in the award of a degree. The
research then proves the hypothesis, disproves it, narrows it down as
incomplete, or uncovers extra structure that would require
substantially more work to explore &#8212; or some combination of&nbsp;these.</p>
<p>There are several reasons to like this style of thesis. Firstly, the
hypothesis is usually something concrete within the field of study.
(It may seem hopelessly abstract to anyone outside the field, of
course.) That makes it easy for an examiner or other reader to relate
to: the question makes sense to them, as something one would want to
know the answer to. Secondly &#8212; and more importantly &#8212; you have a
pretty clear goal and consequently a pretty good notion of when you&#8217;re
finished. A PhD can almost always go on for ever, of course, but
having a tight hypothesis means that you have a reference against
which to test the work and decide whether it&#8217;s sufficient to convince
the reader of your&nbsp;conclusions.</p>
<p>Against this we may contrast the second type of&nbsp;thesis:</p>
<p><strong>Adventures in your chosen field.</strong> In this kind of
thesis, there is no hypothesis. Instead, the thesis marks-out an area
of interest and explores it, with a view to understanding or
characterising some or all of it but without any driving question that
demands an answer. Unlike the hypothesis, this kind of thesis isn&#8217;t
really &#8220;for&#8221; anything: it&#8217;s intended as an exploration, a search for
features &#8212; and indeed possibly for hypotheses to be tested in the
future. But this style of thesis is perfect for some areas, like
mathematics and the more abstract end of computer science, where
something new needs to be explored for a while to see if it makes
sense and what is has to offer. (It&#8217;s also found in non-monographical
theses, where some universities allow candidates to submit a portfolio
of published papers in place of the traditional approach. I must say I
always find theses like these quite disjointed and fundamentally
dissatisfying: there&#8217;s a lot to be said for a purpose-written, rounded
monograph as a conclusion to a programme of&nbsp;research.)</p>
<p>One would probably have to admit that an &#8220;adventures&#8221; thesis is a
little more challenging to examine, since it doesn&#8217;t motivate its own
intention as clearly as a &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; thesis. It&#8217;s going to be
harder for the candidate to decide when it&#8217;s ready, too, since one can
always do <em>just one more</em> search to find something else of
interest. In that sense, an &#8220;adventurer&#8221; needs to be more disciplined
both in deciding when enough is enough and in deciding what, of the
many possible choices, constitute the interesting pathways to&nbsp;explore.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think either style is inherently preferable. It depends
entirely on the subject matter, and one could easily fall into the
mistake of trying to construct a hypothesis for work that was really
an &#8220;adventure&#8221;, or indeed not constructing one for a thesis that
really needed one to motivate and structure it. There&#8217;s a clear
difference between an exploratory thesis and a rambling one: the
exploration needs structure and&nbsp;coherence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also perhaps worth considering the psychologies and research
styles of different students. Some students need concrete goals: to
build something, to test something, to prove or disprove a conjecture.
These people clearly benefit from doing &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; theses. Other
students have an interest in an area rather than in any specific
outcome, and so might prefer an &#8220;adventure&#8221;. There&#8217;s no point in
forcing one into the other, any more than one can get a
theoretically-inclined student motivated by coding (and the associated
debugging): it&#8217;s just not what floats their boat, and it&#8217;s better that
they know their own minds, strengths and interests than to spend three
or four years engaged in a quest to which they&#8217;re fundamentally&nbsp;misaligned.</p>

The Holga is the camera that took the photography world by storm: a
plastic-lensed, minimally-controlled, manual camera taking 120
medium-format film, offering a distorted and moody aesthetic that's
completely in tune as a response to today's digital precision.

I bought my Holga in 2007. Despite the awkwardness of shooting on film
when you have a largely digital workflow, I still love it for its
throwback feel. The atmosphere it creates in some classes of shot are
difficult if not impossible to fake.

Tuscany and Bologna seem to me to be the heart of Italy, from
mountaintop villages to the mediaeval cities themselves. Lucca has
spectacular walls and a garden tower, shorter than Bologna's two
towers but still offering an amazing climbs and views to
match. Montefegatessi and Lucchio occupy spectacular positions, made
more spectacular by the feats of architecture they're engendered --
including the tradition of placing rocks on the roof to protect the
tiles from high winds in the former, and the Roman lookout fort in the
latter.

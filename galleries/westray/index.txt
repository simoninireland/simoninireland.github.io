Westray, one of the outer Orkney islands, is noted as a bird nesting
site, especially for puffins and gannets. It's also home to
spectacular beaches and a population of seals, crabs, and other
wildlife. Because of its position between the North Sea and the
Atlantic Ocean it has dramatic weather and skies -- altogether a joy
to photograph.

I have to say I got rather obsessed with visiting the puffins. While
not quite tame, they're entirely used to people (especially
photographers) coming very close to themselves and their nesting
burrows. I didn't manage to get a shot of one of them bringing a
beak-full of sand eels, their favourite food, back to the nest, but I
think I captured their cuteness fairly well.

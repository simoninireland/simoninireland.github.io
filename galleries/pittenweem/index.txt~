[Pittenweem](https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/pittenweem/pittenweem/index.html)
is one of the Fife fishing villages on the Firth of Forth, the only
remaining landing port for the fishing fleet of the
[East Neuk of Fife](http://www.welcometofife.com/region/east-neuk).
It gets the most amazing skyscapes and sunsets, as well as the
occasional autumn storm that brings waves breaking over the pier.

Sanday is one of the outer Orkney islands, two ferries distant from
the mainland of Scotland. It's low-lying and ... well ... sandy, with
what I think are some of the most beautiful beaches this side of
Hawai'i.

The archaeology on Sanday really stands out too, ranging from the
slightly mysterious Quoyness Cairn, accessed through a 7m crawl
tunnel, through the "Devil's clawmarks" at the abandoned Lady kirk, to
the wreck of the B98, a First World War German destroyer that sank
after being re-purposed as a mail picket boat after the German High
Seas Fleet was interned at Scapa Flow.

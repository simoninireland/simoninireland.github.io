	 <p>
	   I'm a computer scientist interested in complex and
	   self-adaptive systems,  where chains of cause and effect
	   can be difficult to establish.
	 <p>
	   In my <a href="/research/">research</a> I build the
	   computational tools needed to study and simulate these
	   systems at scale; develop better ways to understand them
	   using advanced analytical techniques; and work on relating
	   these techniques to engineering and rel-world sensing.
	 <p>
	   I <a href="/writing/">write</a> about various topics in
	   science, computing, research practice, and books, and
	   <a href="/development/projects/">develop software</a>
	   in (mainly) <a href="/categories/python">Python</a> and
	   <a href="/categories/lisp">Lisp</a>.

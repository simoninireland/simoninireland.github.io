	 <p>
	   I'm a computer scientist interested in complex systems, where chains
	   of cause and effect can be difficult to establish.
	 <p>
	   I build the computational tools needed to study these systems at scale, which
	   includes using simulators and cloud computing solutions;
	   develop better ways to understand them using advanced analytical techniques;
	   and work on integrating sensors to incorporate real-world, real-time data.
	 <p>
	   Most of my work is in Python, but I also write a lot of
	   Lisp and occasionally C and C++.

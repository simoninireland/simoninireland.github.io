	 <p>
	   I'm a computer scientist interested in complex systems,
	   where chains of cause and effect can be difficult to establish.
	 <p>
	   In my <a href="/research/">research</a> I build the
	   computational tools needed to study these
	   systems at scale, which includes using simulators and cloud
	   computing solutions; develop better ways to understand them
	   using advanced analytical techniques; and work on
	   integrating sensors to incorporate real-world, real-time
	   data to build "digital twins".
	 <p>
	   I <a href="/writing/">write</a> about various topics in
	   science, computing, research practice, and books, and
	   <a href="/development/projects/">develop software</a>
	   in (mainly) Python and Lisp.

`simplicial` is a Python library for experimenting with simplicial
topological complexes.

Simplicial topology is used to build topological spaces from smaller
discrete units called *simplices* (singular: *simplex*). These have many
uses, for example as discrete approximations of continuous spaces or
manifolds, or abstractly reflecting the structure of information. In
either case, we can they study the underlying system using the
operations of algebraic topology.

In particular, simplicial topology has applications in sensor networks
for things like target evaluation and the analysis of goodness-of-fit
of approximations derived from sensors. The mathematics gets quite
involved, and for a computer scientist itâ€™s often easier to understand
code, so I wrote this small library to help me explore the ideas.

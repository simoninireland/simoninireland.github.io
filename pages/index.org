<p>
I'm a computer scientist interested in complex systems, where chains
of cause and effect can be difficult to establish.

<p>
I build the computational tools needed to study these systems at scale, which
includes using simulators and cloud computing solutions;
develop better ways to understand them using advanced analytical techniques;
and work on integrating sensors into them to incorporate real-world,
real-time data.

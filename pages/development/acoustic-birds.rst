Bird counting with acoustic sensing
===================================

Everybody likes birds, which makes them a great environment for
sensing. There are already a lot of platforms available for detecting,
identifying, and counting birds, and I decided to deploy some of them,
largely for practice but also to feed-into some work we've been doing
on target counting and estimation.

The starting point was `BirdNet_Pi
<https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Installation-Guide>`_,
an acoustic bird-identification platform running on a Raspberry Pi and
making use of the `BirdNET <https://birdnet.cornell.edu/>`_ platform
developed at Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The great part is that all
the recognition runs locally, making use a pre-trained machine
learning model.

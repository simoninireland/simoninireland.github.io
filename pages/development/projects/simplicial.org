  ~simplicial~ is a Python library for experimenting with simplicial
  topological complexes.

  Simplicial topology is used to build topological spaces from smaller
  discrete units called *simplices* (singular: *simplex*). These have many
  uses, for example as discrete approximations of continuous spaces or
  manifolds, or abstractly reflecting the structure of information. In
  either case, we can they study the underlying system using the
  operations of algebraic topology.

  In particular, simplicial topology has applications in sensor networks
  for things like target evaluation and the analysis of goodness-of-fit
  of approximations derived from sensors. The mathematics gets quite
  involved, and for a computer scientist itâ€™s often easier to understand
  code, so I wrote this small library to help me explore the ideas.

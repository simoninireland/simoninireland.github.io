Citizen sensing
===============

In 2013 I did a summer project on using the `Arduino <https://arduino.cc>`_
as a platform for "citizen
sensing". This rapidly became an exploration of how to create hardware
and software that can do sensing while operating in a very low-power
regime, such as one would need for an environmental sensor.

There were several results from this project -- one of which *wasn't*
an actual solution to the motivating problem I'd come up with.
However, it did generate a lot of notes about low-power Arduino
programming, both for hardware and software, and a software library
that embodies some of them. These may still be of interest to anyone
wanting to use Arduino technology for low-power environmental sensing.

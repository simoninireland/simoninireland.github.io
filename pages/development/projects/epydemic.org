  ~epydemic~ is a library for simulating epidemic (and other)
  processes over complex networks (and other combinatorial
  structures).

  Network science uses epidemic spreading processes a lot, both for
  the obvious application of modelling diseases, but also for things
  that are mathematically similar such as computer viruses and
  rumour-spreading. Some simulations use discrete-time approaches
  where lots of events happen in a single timestep; others — and this
  is more common for research-grade software — use continuous-time
  stochastic or Gillespie simulation, which can be significantly
  faster and is statistically exact, but is also a lot harder to code
  up. There didn’t seem to be a reusable simulation library that would
  play well with [[https://networkx.github.io/][networkx]], so I wrote one in the course of writing my
  complex networks blog/book. `epydemic` releases this code from the
  book and allows it to be used stand-alone. For good measure I
  integrated it with [[link:/development/projects/epyc/][epyc]] to allow for reproducible
  simulations at scale.

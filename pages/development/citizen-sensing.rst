In 2013 I did a summer project on using the `Arduino <https://arduino.cc>`_
as a platform for "citizen
sensing". This rapidly became an exploration of how to create hardware
and software that can do sensing while operating in a very low-power
regime, such as one would need for an environmental sensor.

There were several results from this project -- one of which
*wasn't* an actual solution to the motivating problem I'd come
up with. However, it did generate a lot of notes about low-power
Arduino programming, both for hardware and software, and a software
library that embodies some of them

Below are some notes I made as the project went along.

Academic writing
----------------

My academic work can be found on my `publications page <link:/research/publications>`_

My recent book, *Epidemic modelling: Some notes, maths, and code*,
is available to `buy <https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1838535659/>`_ or to
`read online <https://simondobson.org/introduction-to-epidemics>`_. I've also written about
`the experience of self-publishing a scientific textbook <link:/2020/07/22/self-publishing/>`_ for anyone
thinking of doing the same.

I've written some notes on `writing abstracts for papers
<link:/2020/08/06/how-to-write-an-abstract>`_ (and why to do it this
way), which is something many people struggle with early in their
careers.

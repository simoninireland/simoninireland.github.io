Academic writing
----------------

Most of my academic work can be found on my `publications page <link:/research/publications>`_

My recent book, /Epidemic modelling: Some notes, maths, and code/,
is available to `buy <https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1838535659/>`_ or to
`read online <https://simondobson.org/introduction-to-epidemics>`_. I've also written about
`the experience of self-publishing a scientific textbook <link:/2020/07/22/self-publishing/>`_ for anyone
thinking of doing the same.

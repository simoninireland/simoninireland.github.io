Article series
==============

I tend to write short-form articles on this site. Some of these I've
brought together as curated series that can be read together as
long-form.

- `An annotated Lisp bibliography
  <link:/development/annotated-lisp-bibliography/>`_, a curated and
  commented list of references into the enormous Lisp literature
- `Bird counting with acoustic sensing
  <link:/development/acoustic-birds/>`_, using largely off-the-shelf
  hardware to drive some experiments in data analytics for estimating
  bird abundance
- `A citizen sensing project
  <link:/development/projects/citizen-sensing>`_ to explore doing
  environment sensing with off-the-shelf Arduino hardware
- `Book reviews <link:/categories/books/>`_, including all those read
  by my `book club <link:/categories/bonanza/>`_ over the past years

*Complex networks, complex processes: A network science miscellany* is
best described as a book that's being written openly and non-linearly.

Network science requires that we can do two things well: develop
mathematical descriptions of networks and the fascinating processes
that run over them; and develop software to simulate these systems to
verify the descriptions. Few people are equally skilled in both
skill-sets. I've been exceptionally fortunate to work with several
very able and mathematically gifted colleagues, but there's still
often a major gap in understanding the relationships between the maths
and the code, as well as in the quality of the tooling itself. The
latter motivated the development of
[`epydemic`](/development/epydemic/); the former motivated writing this
book. It's very much an on-going work-in-progress.

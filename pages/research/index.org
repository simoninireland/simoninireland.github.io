** Current interests

   My current research interests are in complex systems, in particular
   how to represent and analyse them mathematically, and how to
   simulate them computationally.

   The representations I'm currently interested in most use network
   science to study how processes flow over complex networks. However,
   many processes can't be represented efficiently like this, and I'm
   really interested in exploring some other approaches such as
   simplicial topology, discrete calculus, differential geometry, and
   discrete sheaves.

   But I'm mainly a computer scientist, which makes me mainly a
   tool-builder, and so the challenge of these problems for me is how
   to represent and manipulate them efficiently and at scale. This has
   resulted in my creating and maintaining several [[link:/development/projects][software libraries]]
   to explore simulation and analysis.

   I've worked on lots of [[link:/research/old-research-interests/][other topics]] in then past, and several large
   [[link:/research/projects/][projects]].

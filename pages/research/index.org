* Current interests

  My current research interests are in complex systems and sensing, in
  particular how to build, represent, and analyse them mathematically
  and how to simulate them computationally.

  The representations I'm currently interested in most use network
  science to study how processes operate over complex networks. However,
  many processes can't be represented efficiently like this, and I'm
  really interested in exploring some higher-order approaches such as
  simplicial topology, discrete calculus, differential geometry, and
  discrete sheaves.

  But I'm mainly a computer scientist, which makes me mainly a
  tool-builder, and so the challenge of these problems for me is how
  to represent and manipulate them efficiently and at scale. This has
  resulted in my creating and maintaining several [[link:/development/projects][software libraries]]
  to explore simulation and analysis.

  I've worked on lots of [[link:/research/old-research-interests/][other topics]] in the past, and several large
  [[link:/research/projects/][projects]].

The [GLOSS project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2000-26070) was
funded by the EU under its "Disappearing computer" initiative to look
at ways of building an infrastructure for global smart interactive
spaces. It was a consortium of universities:

* University of Strathclyde UK (lead)
* Universit&eacute; Joseph Fourier Grenoble FR
* UCD Dublin IE
* University of St Andrews UK

The project developed both the theory and practice of pervasive
computing. For the former, we explored three "metaphors" of pervasive
systems:

* **Trails**, capturing where a user went over the course of their
  interactions;
* **Radar**, allowing them to find things and people nearby; and
* **Hearsay**, letting them leave notes in space to be picked up
  later.

The first two are now commonplace in mobile computing; the third less
so, which is interesting, as it let users annotate space as well
as online resources, for example picking up notes left by others at
connected displays.

It's perhaps easier now than it was then to imagine how this might
have played out if deployed at scale: probably not well.

We embodied these metaphors in prototype middleware that was then
demonstrated using what was then the state of the art in mobile
computing, the [Compaq iPAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPAQ), with
sensors literally glued onto the back.

As with a lot of research projects it's hard to tell exactly what
impact this work had. It contributed to the science of pervasive
computing, and trained up a significant number of PhD students and
postdocs who later took up posts in academia and industry. Some of the
ideas in modern mobile systems clearly share ideas from GLOSS, but
whether there's a causative chain is impossible to know.

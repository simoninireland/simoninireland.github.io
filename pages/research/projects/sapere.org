  The [[https://sites.google.com/site/sapereprojecteu/][Sapere project]] was a project funded by the EU's Future and
  Emerging Technologies strand of Framework 7. The goal was to explore
  how to use nature-inspired computing techniques to implement
  scalable services adapted to their location and context. It was a
  consortium of five universities from across Europe:

  - Universit\agrave di Modena \egrave Reggio Emilia IT (lead)
  - Alma Mater Studiorum, Universit\agrave di Bologna IT
  - University of Geneva CH
  - Johannes Kepler Universit\auml{}t Linz AT
  - University of St Andrews UK

  The project developed a middleware that exposed the endpoints of
  programs running in the system as packets of open data, called *Live
  Semantic Annotations* or LSAs, which were
  then operated on by a small set of declarative rules. This allowed a
  very decentralised approach to distributed systems, both in space and
  time: new components could join (or leave), with the system also
  responding autonomously to mobility and local failures.

  We ran an instance of the middleware to host a user-facing
  application for the 2013 Vienna City Marathon, which tried to manage
  crowds of spectators wanting to watch the action and see their
  favourite runners.

  The St Andrews' work package within the project explored how to do
  situation recognition in a distributed and scalable manner on top of
  the middleware architecture. We implemented both known and novel
  algorithms, driven by a changing pattern of sensors each represented
  by an LSA. This was a far more dynamic approach than had been tried
  before, and it led us to have to consider the impacts of partial
  failures in the sensors, poor and uneven coverage, which informed a
  lot of our subsequent work.

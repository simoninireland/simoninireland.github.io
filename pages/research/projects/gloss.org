  The [[https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2000-26070][GLOSS project]] was funded by the EU under its "Disappearing
  computer" initiative to look at ways of building an infrastructure
  for global smart interactive spaces. It was a consortium of
  universities:

  - University of Strathclyde UK (lead)
  - Universit\eacute Joseph Fourier Grenoble FR
  - UCD Dublin IE
  - University of St Andrews UK

  The project developed both the theory and practice of pervasive
  computing. For the former, we explored three "metaphors" of pervasive
  systems:

  - **Trails**, capturing where a user went over the course of their
    interactions;
  - **Radar**, allowing them to find things and people nearby; and
  - **Hearsay**, letting them leave notes in space to be picked up
    later.

  The first two are now commonplace in mobile computing; the third less
  so, which is interesting, as it let users annotate space as well
  as online resources, for example picking up notes left by others at
  connected displays.

  It's perhaps easier now than it was then to imagine how this might
  have played out if deployed at scale: probably not well.

  We embodied these metaphors in prototype middleware that was then
  demonstrated using what was then the state of the art in mobile
  computing, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPAQ][Compaq iPAQ]], with sensors literally glued onto the
  back.

  As with a lot of research projects it's hard to tell exactly what
  impact this work had. It contributed to the science of pervasive
  computing, and trained up a significant number of PhD students and
  postdocs who later took up posts in academia and industry. Some of the
  ideas in modern mobile systems clearly share ideas from GLOSS, but
  whether there's a causative chain is impossible to know.

NEMBES -- Networks embedded systems in the built environment -- was a
project funded in Ireland to explore how to improve building
performance and building.  It involved researchers from Trinity
College, UCD, Cork IT, the Tyndall Institute, and others institutions.

The consortium was an interesting mix of hardware engineers and
software researchers, with very different ideas about what constituted
"systems": indeed, one of the best parts of the project was in working
out exactly what we all meant and how our ideas fitted together!

Our part of the work mainly focused on sensor networks and their
applications. We looked at robustness to errors, since that's a major
issue for built structures. We also explored localisation using
ultrasonic signals, which again are a great way to deal with
in-building localisation built-into the infrastructure.

With my colleague Kieran Delaney I also did some preparatory work on
building materials "augmented" with computational elements. This idea
built on the work on [amorphous
computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_computing), but with
computing elements included into physical materials. This opens-up a
lot of opportunities, since the computing and the material become
essentially inseparable; it's also challenging to consider how one
would bind electronics to a physical material in a way that will
survive some of the processes materials go through. (It was a surprise
to learn exactly how hot concrete gets as it cures.) It's a topic that
I'd like to go back to in terms of the approrpiate programming
paradigms.

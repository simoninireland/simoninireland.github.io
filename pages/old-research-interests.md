In the past I’ve worked on a range of areas. Some are still of
interest; some not so much; and some are now in the mainstream.

## Programming languages

OK, not so much of a past interest, it’s a current interest that I
don’t have an active research programme in. In another sense, though,
everything I do is about programming languages, or at least about ways
to capture computational processes in a way that’s simple and
accessible to people. At their broadest, programming languages are
about allowing people to express their computational ideas easily, and
that’s something that underpins all computer science research.

I’ve developed a number of software systems in the past, including a
system for prototyping programming language interpreters (Vanilla) and
a modern Forth compiler that we used for experiments in sensor network
programming (Attila). Both are still available, and may even work on
modern systems: your mileage may vary.


## Autonomic computing

Making large computer systems more manageable involves improving the
ways in which they model and control their own behaviour in response
to changing conditions. I worked a lot on whole-system models of
adaptive behaviour, which eventually narrowed into an interest in
managing sensor systems.


## Pervasive computing

Another topic that’s still of interest, although perhaps not in a
mainstream way. I used to work on assisted living and other
applications of pervasive systems; now I focus on situation
recognition, which — while it’s a technique with deep applications in
pervasive systems — is somewhat broader and can be applied to all
aspects of data science and sensing. Essentially we don’t care where
the data comes from when interpreting it, so we can look at the deeper
algorithmic issues rather than just the applications.


## Distributed and web systems

I got into the web early, including putting up one of the first really
large-scale web servers backed by a database and a content manager
(before “content manager” was a thing). Many of the techniques we
looked at back then (in the mid-1990’s) have since morphed into the
mainstream, in radically different (and mainly better) forms to the
ways we envisioned them.

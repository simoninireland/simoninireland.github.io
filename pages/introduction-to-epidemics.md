The 2020 covid-19 pandemic made it clear how much we depend on a
public understanding of science. Without public confidence it's
impossible to follow and maintain the sorts of strategies we need to
keep us all safe in the face of a new and poorly-understood disease.

A lot of the public communications from government referred to "the
science", and especially to modelling of possible disease and
countermeasures scenarios. Several people asked me about what this
meant: what *is* a disease model, how to we evaluate what they're
saying, and so forth. So I decided to write an introduction to the
parts of this vast and complicated subject that I know something
about: epidemic spreading on networks.

<h2 id="org0dae078">Trying to refute some criticisms of&nbsp;Lisp</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0dae078">
<p>
I recently had a discussion with someone on Mastodon about Lisp and
its perceived (by them) deficiencies as a language. There were some
interesting points, but I felt I had to try to refute them, at least&nbsp;partially.
</p>

<p>
I should say from the start the I&#8217;m not blind to Lisp&#8217;s many
inadequacies and anachronisms, merely pointing out that it has a
context like everything&nbsp;else.
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be two main&nbsp;issues:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Poor design decisions throughout, and especially a lack of static&nbsp;typing</li>
<li>The shadows of really early machines&nbsp;in <code>car</code> and <code>cadr</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These points are tied together, but let&#8217;s try to unpack&nbsp;them.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org51c0928" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org51c0928">Design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org51c0928">
<p>
Let&#8217;s start with design. Lisp is over half a century old. I&#8217;d argue
it was exceptionally well-designed – when it was designed. It
lacks most modern advances in types because … well, they didn&#8217;t
exist, many of them arose as solutions to perceived problems in
Lisp (and Fortran), and many of those &#8220;solutions&#8221; still aren&#8217;t
universally accepted, such as static typing&nbsp;itself.
</p>

<p>
What we&#8217;ve actually learned is that many aspects of programming
lack any really universal solutions. If static typing were such an
obvious and unarguable route to efficiency and quality, all new
software would be being written in&nbsp;Haskell.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgdd77dd5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdd77dd5">Typing and&nbsp;features</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdd77dd5">
<p>
And the lack of modern types isn&#8217;t really as clear-cut as it
appears. The argument about the <i>lack</i> of features in Lisp also
ignores the <i>presence</i> of other features that are absent from
almost all other&nbsp;languages.
</p>

<p>
Lisp&#8217;s numeric types are surprisingly flexible. Indeed, Common Lisp
is still, in the 21st century, just about the only language in
which one can write modern crypto algorithms like Diffie-Hellman
key exchange without recourse to additional libraries, because it
has arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic built-in to the standard
operators. It also has rational numbers, so no loss of precision on
division&nbsp;either.
</p>

<p>
The Common Lisp Object System (<span class="caps">CLOS</span>) is vastly more flexible than
<i>any</i> modern object-oriented language. Sub-class methods can
specify their relationship with the methods they override, such as
being called after or just filtering the return values. Methods
themselves are multiple-dispatch and so can be selected based on
the types of their arguments as well as their target. The basic
mechanisms can be overridden or extended using a meta-object&nbsp;protocol.
</p>

<p>
Then there are macros. It&#8217;s easy to underestimate these: after all,
C has macros, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, yes – and no. A C macro is a
function from strings to strings that can do literal string
substitution of its arguments. A Lisp macro is a function from code
to code that can perform arbitrary computation. They&#8217;re really not
the same things at all, and it&#8217;s misleading that the same word is
used for both. (C++ templates are a closer analogy, but still
limited in&nbsp;comparison.)
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgb318967" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb318967">The persistence of hardware 1: Stupid operation&nbsp;names</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb318967">
<p>
The complaints&nbsp;about <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are long established: they
were originally derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR_and_CDR">machine-language instructions on the
<span class="caps">IBM</span> 704</a> that was used for the first Lisp implementations. They&#8217;re
a terrible hold-over from that terrible decision … aren&#8217;t&nbsp;they?
</p>

<p>
Well, yes – and no. Of course they&#8217;re terrible in one sense.&nbsp;But
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are basically nouns as far as Lisp programmers are
concerned. One could replace them with more modern usages&nbsp;like
<code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> (and indeed many Lisps define these using&nbsp;macros).
</p>

<p>
But it&#8217;s important to remember that even &#8220;head&#8221; and &#8220;tail&#8221; are
analogies, sanctified by familiarity in the computer science
literature but still inexplicable to anyone outside. (If you doubt
that, try explaining to someone who isn&#8217;t a programmer that a
shopping list has a &#8220;head&#8221; consisting of the first entry, and a
&#8220;tail&#8221; consisting of another, shorter, shopping list, is &#8220;in fact&#8221;
a recursive type, and you have to acquire each item of shopping
sequentially by working your way down the list from the&nbsp;head.)
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are artificial nouns,&nbsp;and <code>cons</code> is an artificial
verb – but really no more artificial&nbsp;that <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>,&nbsp;and
<code>append</code>, their rough equivalents in other&nbsp;languages.
</p>

<p>
One can argue that the persistence&nbsp;of <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> drives the
persistence of compounds&nbsp;like <code>caaddr</code>. But those are unnecessary
and seldom used: barely anyone would mind if they were&nbsp;removed.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7f8b169" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7f8b169">The persistence of hardware 2: It happens a&nbsp;lot</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7f8b169">
<p>
The suggestion that Lisp has hardware holdovers that should be
removed also neglects these holdovers in other&nbsp;languages.
</p>

<p>
As an example, check the definition&nbsp;of <code>std::memcpy</code> in C++. It
doesn&#8217;t work with overlapping memory areas. Why is that? – why is
it so fast, but so dangerous? Does it relate to underlying machine
features, such as machine code move instructions on particular
machines with particular restrictions? Doesn&#8217;t this introduce the
risk of security flaws like buffer&nbsp;overruns?
</p>

<p>
Languages with more abstracted machine models don&#8217;t have these
issues. I struggle to think of how one could even introduce the
<i>concept</i> of a buffer overrun into Lisp, other than by using some
external raw-memory-access library: the language itself is immune,
as far as I&nbsp;know.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org39895fa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org39895fa">The different&nbsp;choices</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org39895fa">
<p>
For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s turn the argument around and ask:
give that early Lisps had proper macros, arbitrary-precision
integers, and so on, why did these features disappear from what we
now consider to be &#8220;the mainstream&#8221; of programming language&nbsp;design?
</p>

<p>
Lisp&#8217;s designers had a goal of building a powerful machine in which
to think: indeed, they intended it to eventually have its own
hardware designed specifically for it to run on. They therefore
didn&#8217;t buy into the necessity of immediate performance, and as
their applications were largely symbolic <span class="caps">AI</span> they didn&#8217;t need
numerical performance at all. They chose instead to create high-level
constructs even if these couldn&#8217;t be compiled efficiently, and
explored using these to create more code as they identified more
and more abstract patterns whose details could be automated away.
(Paul Graham has <a href="https://paulgraham.com/diff.html">a great essay</a> on&nbsp;this.)
</p>

<p>
Other language designers had other priorities. Often they needed to
do numerical simulation, and needed both performance and scale. So
they chose a different design pathway, emphasising efficient
compilation to the hardware they had available, and made the
compromises needed to get it. These have persisted, and that&#8217;s why
we have languages with fixed-width integers scaled to fit into a
single machine register, and compilers that generate – but don&#8217;t
directly execute – the code of programs, which limits our ability
to abstract and automate code generation without recourse to
complicated external&nbsp;tools.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s interesting to explore these choices. They&#8217;re at one level
&#8220;just&#8221; historical: accidents that shaped the present. But at
another level they&#8217;re still very much present in the hardware and
software landscape we inhabit. I think it&#8217;s important that we
remind ourselves, continuously, that <i>much of that landscape is a
choice</i>, not a given, and one we can question and change as we&nbsp;wish.
